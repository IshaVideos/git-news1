The government has worked for the people, the poorest of the poor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;  \u201cI am not a spokesperson of the government, but the current prime minister and his governance is what we had imagined and wished for,\u201d he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Responding to a question, Giri said the country now needs to focus on three areas on a priority basis, first having a uniform civil code, secondly right to education and finally right to vote wherein every citizen has to vote during elections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &quot;There should be one law, one country. Uniform Civil Code is the need of the hour. The Uttarakhand Government has taken an initiative in this regard, and we all are supporting it. Every citizen of the country should have the right to education. There should be a law which makes voting compulsory,&quot; he explained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Giri, who has travelled a large part of the world, said  the Hindu civilization and its way of living has spread across the world. It\u2019s yoga which helped people survive during the COVID-19 pandemic, he observed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; \u201cPeople now are doing yoga all over the world. I was in Saudi Arabia about a month ago. It is nothing but surprising that about half of the country\u2019s population has now become vegan,\u201d he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Observing that materialistic life does not bring in true happiness and self-satisfaction, the Hindu leader said that brandization and commercialization has never been part of India\u2019s ethos and culture. Because of its basic values and ethos, Hindu culture has now spread across the world, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;  \u201cWe have not converted anyone. So, we are not in numbers. But people across the world are now following the key tenets and practices of Hinduism,\u201d Swami Avdheshanand Giri asserted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Hindu culture is based on the basic values of truth and that\u2019s the reason why this civilization has continued to exist and thrive even today while there are no takers for many of its contemporaries, he reasoned.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In response to a question, the Hindu leader said there is need to \u201cbe alert\u201d on demographic changes in the country. Without much explanation, he said the demographic changes have taken place in Europe too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;  \u201cI have seen London, France 30 years ago and today there is a sharp demographic change,\u201d he said, adding that India today faces a big challenge in terms of demographic changes and population control.

Five days later, he developed a mild fever and decided to seek medical help. Things took a serious turn when, after laboratory and radiology investigations, doctors diagnosed him with TTP.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; \u201cDuring the initial evaluation, he seemed to be suffering from acute pancreatitis. But he had low red blood cell and platelet counts that did not correlate with the preliminary diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; \u201cThe ADAMTS 13 test confirmed he had TTP, a rare disease that can be fatal if left untreated. This is the first case of TTP we are coming across in our hospital,\u201d said Dr Ashraf Abdelrahman, HOD, Critical Care Services at Lifecare.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Dr Abdelrahman said that such patients require close monitoring as they are at high risk for altered conscious level, seizures, hemiplegia and multiorgan failure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; For a patient confirmed with TTP, the treatment itself can induce serious hemodynamic instability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Dr Mathew Vadakoot, Specialist Gastroenterologist, said diagnosing TTP was the main challenge they faced.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; TTP is a rare disease with very vague symptoms, and the confirmatory test is performed only in a few laboratories in the country.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The hospital shifted Harkesh to the ICU and formed a 12-member multi-disciplinary team of doctors to analyse his health condition and plan the next steps.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; \u201cHarkesh received a total of 10 sessions of TPE daily with almost 30 liters of plasma exchanged. He was also treated with steroids and monoclonal antibodies medications,\u201d said Dr AbeeshPadmanabha Pillai, Specialist Nephrologist.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; As he had neurological symptoms of seizures and loss of consciousness level, doctors deeply sedated and endotracheally intubated him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He remained on mechanical ventilation till complications were controlled and his condition improved. It took around 18 days for Harkesh, who hails from Himachal Pradesh, to recover from this flare-up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; \u201cI had pain for around 20 days. I thought it was typical gas trouble. But later, I found that I was diagnosed with a rare disease, and I got scared.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; \u201cThe doctors and other hospital staff supported me mentally and physically. All thanks to the Almighty and doctors. This is my second life,\u201d said Harkesh, who works as a foreman in a company in Abu Dhabi.

A solar day, which is the time it takes for the Earth to rotate about its axis so that the Sun appears in the same position in the sky, is longer than 24 hours near the solstice, according to NASA.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Is The Longest Day Of The Year Also The Hottest?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Despite the fact that June Solstice is the longest day of the year for those living in the Northern Hemisphere, it is not the hottest day of the year. Instead, the Northern Hemisphere witnesses the hottest weather in late July and August.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;This is due to an effect called lag of the seasons, according to &lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;EarthSky&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;. Lag of the seasons is the same reason it is hotter in mid-afternoon than at noon. After a long winter, it takes the Earth some time to warm up. Ice and snow blanket the ground in some places of Earth, even in the month of June. It is only after the Sun melts the ice and warms the oceans that we feel the most sweltering summer heat.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Though ice and snow have been melting since spring began, and meltwater and rainwater have been percolating down through the snow at the top of glaciers, the runoff from the glaciers is not as great now as it will be in July.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;As a result, the Northern Hemisphere will witness the hottest weather in July or August, a time when the days begin to shorten again.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Science Behind Summer Solstice&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Earth has seasons because the planet's imaginary axis is tilted. The northern summer solstice is an instant in time when the north pole of the Earth points more directly toward the Sun than at any other time of the year, marking the beginning of the astronomical summer season in the Northern Hemisphere and the astronomical winter season in the Southern Hemisphere.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Therefore, all locations north of the equator will see days longer than 12 hours and all locations south of the equator will see days shorter than 12 hours.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;", "link": "https://news.abplive.com/science/summer-solstice-2022-astronomical-summer-season-begins-on-june-21-in-northern-hemisphere-all-you-want-to-know-1538217", "published_js": "2022-06-20", "author": "Radifah Kabir"}, {"title": "Sri Lanka Crisis: Former World Cup Winner Serves Tea To People Waiting In Queues At Petrol Station", "summary": "&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;New Delhi:&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;nbsp;Former Sri Lankan cricketer and world cup winner Roshan Mahanama has been offering tea and buns to the people struggling to get petrol in the crisis-hit country and forced to wait in long queues. &amp;nbsp;In a tweet on June 18, Roshan Mahanama said Sri Lankans needed to look after each other in difficult times.
