This article also includes input from XDA\u2019s Editor in Chief, Aamir Siddiqui, using his personal iPhone 13 Pro and an X80 Pro provided by Vivo India. Vivo India additionally took Aamir and other Indian media persons and YouTubers to Dubai for an immersion session centered around the phone. Vivo is also running a campaign on XDA around this phone, but that is handled by the sponsorship team independent from the editorial team. Neither Samsung nor Vivo had any input in this article.\u00a0</em></p>\n<hr />\n<h2>Apple iPhone 13 Pro Max vs Vivo X80 Pro: Design and Hardware</h2>\n<p>Unless you&#8217;ve just woken up from a coma, there&#8217;s not much need for me to describe in words what the iPhone 13 Pro Max looks like, right? It&#8217;s a large, blocky flagship with glass front and back and stainless steel flat sides &#8212; this latter part gives the phone its hefty, brick-like feeling. In my opinion, Apple&#8217;s flat boxy design looks good and gives the phone an authoritative, machine vibe that runs in contrast to most Android flagships, most of which are wrapped by gentle curvature. The Vivo X80 Pro definitely fits that vibe, with a soft frosted coating to its glass back that feels silky and slippery to my hands.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"iPhone 13 Pro Max and vivo x80 pro\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-650633\" height=\"600\" src=\"https://www.xda-developers.com/files/2022/06/DSC04539-1024x683.jpg\" width=\"900\" /></p>\n<div class=\"quotecenter\">\n  <figure class=\"wp-block-pullquote quotestyle\">\n    <blockquote class=\"centerquotestyle\">\n      <p>The iPhone 13 Pro Max being too big to be held comfortably is a widely shared view</p>\n    </blockquote>\n  </figure>\n</div>\n\n\n<p>I personally don&#8217;t love the in-hand feel of either phone: I&#8217;m not a fan of the slithery frosted back of the Vivo, and the iPhone 13 Pro Max&#8217;s flat sides results in angular corners that dig into my palm. These are, of course, just my opinions, but I do think the iPhone 13 Pro Max being too big to be held comfortably is a widely shared view. Aamir does find the Vivo X80 Pro to be perfect for his tastes, while sharing the same concerns around the blocky design of the iPhone.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"iPhone 13 Pro Max and Vivo X80 Pro in the hand\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-651215\" height=\"600\" src=\"https://www.xda-developers.com/files/2022/06/vivo-x80-pro-iphone-13-pro-max-xda-455545665667-1024x683.jpg\" width=\"900\" /></p>\n\n<a href=\"https://www.xda-developers.com/files/2022/06/vivo-x80-pro-iphone-13-pro-max-xda-4555456666.jpg\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"attachment-large size-large\" height=\"600\" src=\"https://www.xda-developers.com/files/2022/06/vivo-x80-pro-iphone-13-pro-max-xda-4555456666-1024x683.jpg\" width=\"900\" /></a>\n<a href=\"https://www.xda-developers.com/files/2022/06/DSC04599.jpg\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"attachment-large size-large\" height=\"600\" src=\"https://www.xda-developers.com/files/2022/06/DSC04599-1024x683.jpg\" width=\"900\" /></a>\n\n<p>Both screens look great &#8212; gorgeous, vibrant OLED panels that reach a peak refresh rate of 120Hz. iOS handles 120Hz a bit better than Vivo&#8217;s FunTouchOS in my opinion, as the iPhone&#8217;s animations appear a bit more fluid to my eyes. Maximum screen brightness is about even. The Vivo X80 Pro has a less blemished screen, with only a small hole-punch cut-out compared to the iPhone 13 Pro Max&#8217;s notch, so viewing full-screen videos is a bit more enjoyable on the Vivo X80 Pro.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"viewing full screen videos in the iPhone 13 Pro Max and Vivo X80 Pro\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-650643\" height=\"600\" src=\"https://www.xda-developers.com/files/2022/06/DSC04594-1024x683.jpg\" width=\"900\" /></p>\n<p>There&#8217;s a reason for that notch, however, as it houses not just a 12MP selfie camera but also Apple&#8217;s TrueDepth camera system &#8212; a series of sensors that can map our face in 3D for secure facial recognition. Vivo&#8217;s hole-punch houses just a normal selfie camera, but a more pixel-dense 32MP shooter. Vivo relies on Qualcomm&#8217;s 3D Sonic Max solution for its optical fingerprint sensor: so you get a wider fingerprint sensing area than most Android devices, with the ability for dual-fingerprint sensing and quicker setup and recognition. The Vivo does this implementation excellently, so you are unlikely to miss the iPhone 13 Pro&#8217;s face recognition.</p>\n<p>Powering these phones are the latest SoCs from Apple and Qualcomm: A15 Bionic for the iPhone 13 Pro Max, and Snapdragon 8 Gen 1 for the X80 Pro &#8212; even though Apple&#8217;s chip is technically a 2021 chip, it is still more powerful than the 2022 Qualcomm chip, but the difference will only be noticed for more complicated tasks like rendering videos.</p>\n<p>Apple doesn&#8217;t disclose RAM configuration or battery size, but teardowns have revealed that the iPhone 13 Pro Max packs 6GB of RAM with a 4,352 mAh battery, both are &#8220;less&#8221; than what the Vivo X80 Pro offers &#8212; 12GB of RAM with 4,700 mAh battery &#8212; but real-world results do not reflect that. Due to Apple having better hardware-software synergy than almost any Android phone, iPhones can be more efficient in performance, thus needing fewer GBs of RAM or smaller battery sizes. I&#8217;ll cover this more closely in the performance section, but spoiler alert &#8212; the iPhone 13 Pro Max has better battery life than the Vivo X80 Pro.</p>\n<p>Both phones pack all the flagship smartphone flourishes: stereo speakers, IP68 water and dust resistance, excellent haptics, and wireless charging. The iPhone 13 Pro Max&#8217;s speakers and haptics are noticeably better than Vivo X80 Pro&#8217;s, but in return, Vivo takes a major win in charging &#8212; it can charge <em>much, much faster</em> whether wired or wirelessly, and Vivo includes the charger in the package.</p>\n<hr />\n<h2>Apple iPhone 13 Pro Max vs Vivo X80 Pro: Cameras</h2>\n<p>For optics, the iPhone 13 Pro Max packs a straightforward triple 12MP lens setup covering the ultra-wide, wide, and telephoto focal length. Other than Apple&#8217;s Deep Fusion image processing algorithm and a night mode that turns on automatically, there are not many tricks or gimmicks to this iPhone camera &#8212; no pixel binning nor no specialty sideways lenses. The Vivo X80 Pro does a bit more, with a quad lens system including dual zoom lenses for two optical zoom lengths, and one of these latter lenses is propped up by a miniature gimbal system. There&#8217;s also Zeiss T-coating over every glass so they reduce lens flare, and the main and ultra-wide camera both use pixel binning technology to force a larger micron-pixel size. There&#8217;s just a lot more processing between when Vivo&#8217;s camera hardware snaps the photo and the shot showing up in the photo gallery. Helping matters is Vivo&#8217;s proprietary V1+, a dedicated imaging chip created solely to handle image processing. Apple has its own image processing hardware too, it&#8217;s just part of the A15 Bionic.</p>\n\n<a href=\"https://www.xda-developers.com/files/2021/09/iPhone-13-Pro-Max-XDA-235lkjlksf354aasfs.jpeg\"><img alt=\"iPhone 13 Pro Max\" class=\"attachment-large size-large\" height=\"600\" src=\"https://www.xda-developers.com/files/2021/09/iPhone-13-Pro-Max-XDA-235lkjlksf354aasfs-1024x683.jpeg\" width=\"900\" /></a>\n<a href=\"https://www.xda-developers.com/files/2022/05/vivo-x80-pro-xda-134455346364346634.jpg\"><img alt=\"Vivo X80 Pro\" class=\"attachment-large size-large\" height=\"600\" src=\"https://www.xda-developers.com/files/2022/05/vivo-x80-pro-xda-134455346364346634-1024x683.jpg\" width=\"900\" /></a>\n\n<p>Let&#8217;s first examine photo consistency across all the lenses. In the below set, taken under relatively ideal lighting conditions, we can see that the iPhone does a better job of keeping consistent color temperature between the main and ultra-wide lens, while Vivo&#8217;s exhibit some deviation in the shade of the sky. Both main cameras produced an excellent photo that was sharp, with the right level of contrast and accurate colors. Even when I zoomed in 100% to pixel peep, it was a virtual tie. That&#8217;s not the case with the other lenses.</p>\n\n<a href=\"https://www.xda-developers.com/files/2022/06/IMG_4671.jpg\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"attachment-large size-large\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https://www.xda-developers.com/files/2022/06/IMG_4671-768x1024.jpg\" width=\"768\" /></a>\n<a href=\"https://www.xda-developers.com/files/2022/06/IMG_4672.jpg\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"attachment-large size-large\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https://www.xda-developers.com/files/2022/06/IMG_4672-768x1024.jpg\" width=\"768\" /></a>\n<a href=\"https://www.xda-developers.com/files/2022/06/IMG_4674.jpg\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"attachment-large size-large\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https://www.xda-developers.com/files/2022/06/IMG_4674-768x1024.jpg\" width=\"768\" /></a>\n<a href=\"https://www.xda-developers.com/files/2022/06/IMG_4673.jpg\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"attachment-large size-large\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https://www.xda-developers.com/files/2022/06/IMG_4673-768x1024.jpg\" width=\"768\" /></a>\n<a href=\"https://www.xda-developers.com/files/2022/06/IMG_20220528_193023.jpg\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"attachment-large size-large\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https://www.xda-developers.com/files/2022/06/IMG_20220528_193023-768x1024.jpg\" width=\"768\" /></a>\n<a href=\"https://www.xda-developers.com/files/2022/06/IMG_20220528_193017.jpg\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"attachment-large size-large\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https://www.xda-developers.com/files/2022/06/IMG_20220528_193017-768x1024.jpg\" width=\"768\" /></a>\n<a href=\"https://www.xda-developers.com/files/2022/06/IMG_20220528_193041.jpg\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"attachment-large size-large\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https://www.xda-developers.com/files/2022/06/IMG_20220528_193041-768x1024.jpg\" width=\"768\" /></a>\n<a href=\"https://www.xda-developers.com/files/2022/06/IMG_20220528_193014.jpg\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"attachment-large size-large\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https://www.xda-developers.com/files/2022/06/IMG_20220528_193014-768x1024.jpg\" width=\"768\" /></a>\n\n<p>In the ultra-wide lens, if I zoom in 100% I can see the iPhone&#8217;s ultra-wide is much software at the edges &#8212; this doesn&#8217;t surprise me, as the Vivo X80 Pro&#8217;s ultra-wide is more pixel-dense and uses a larger image sensor size. The difference in image sharpness between ultra-wide shots should be more pronounced at night, marking this as a win for the Vivo.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\" id=\"attachment_651575\" style=\"width: 910px;\"><img alt=\"collage of iphone and vivo shots\" class=\"size-large wp-image-651575\" height=\"675\" src=\"https://www.xda-developers.com/files/2022/06/ultrawidecollage-iphone-vs-vivo-1024x768.jpg\" width=\"900\" /><p class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-651575\">100% crops, ultra-wide shots, iPhone 13 Pro Max (left) and X80 Pro (right).</p></div>\n<p>The iPhone 13 Pro&#8217;s 3x zoom, however, is really good &#8212; perhaps the best telephoto zoom lens in the business. In the below crop, I&#8217;ve taken an iPhone 3x zoom photo, punched in to get the frame closer to Vivo&#8217;s 5x periscope zoom lens, and we can see both shots are about even in image sharpness, with the X80 Pro&#8217;s shot being ever so slightly less noisy. But if we really push the zoom level &#8212; up to 15x, then the X80 Pro&#8217;s shot is a bit sharper because at the end of the day, having a periscope technology is always better than not having one.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\" id=\"attachment_651573\" style=\"width: 910px;\"><img alt=\"cropped samples\" class=\"size-large wp-image-651573\" height=\"675\" src=\"https://www.xda-developers.com/files/2022/06/5xvs3xvivoiphone-1024x768.jpg\" width=\"900\" /><p class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-651573\">Crops of a 3x iPhone 13 Pro Max shot (left) and a 5x X80 Pro shot (right).</p></div>\n<p>But that above scene is considered easy to shoot for modern smartphones, if we move to more challenging scenes such as low light conditions or against harsh backlight, then we start seeing Vivo&#8217;s superior hardware pull off some noticeable wins. In the below set, we can see it is now the iPhone that shows a deviation in color science between the main and ultra-wide camera because the iPhone 13 Pro Max&#8217;s ultra-wide doesn&#8217;t inherently pull in a lot of light naturally, it needed to use a two-second long night mode to produce the shot. Vivo&#8217;s ultra-wide has a larger image sensor and uses pixel-binning technology, so it could snap the below photo normally as if it was shooting during the day.</p>\n\n<a href=\"https://www.xda-developers.com/files/2022/06/IMG_4571.jpg\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"attachment-large size-large\" height=\"675\" src=\"https://www.xda-developers.com/files/2022/06/IMG_4571-1024x768.jpg\" width=\"900\" /></a>\n<a href=\"https://www.xda-developers.com/files/2022/06/IMG_4570.jpg\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"attachment-large size-large\" height=\"675\" src=\"https://www.xda-developers.com/files/2022/06/IMG_4570-1024x768.jpg\" width=\"900\" /></a>\n<a href=\"https://www.xda-developers.com/files/2022/06/IMG_20220526_222331.jpg\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"attachment-large size-large\" height=\"675\" src=\"https://www.xda-developers.com/files/2022/06/IMG_20220526_222331-1024x768.jpg\" width=\"900\" /></a>\n<a href=\"https://www.xda-developers.com/files/2022/06/IMG_20220526_222327.jpg\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"attachment-large size-large\" height=\"675\" src=\"https://www.xda-developers.com/files/2022/06/IMG_20220526_222327-1024x768.jpg\" width=\"900\" /></a>\n\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>iPhone 13 Pro Max above, and Vivo X80 Pro below</em></p>\n<p>If we move to even lower light scenes, like the set below taken in the early pre-dawn morning by Aamir, we can see how much better the Vivo X80 Pro was able to find proper exposure for the sky and the flame.</p>\n\n<a href=\"https://www.xda-developers.com/files/2022/05/IMG_2887.jpg\"><img alt=\"iPhone 13 Pro, main camera\" class=\"attachment-large size-large\" height=\"675\" src=\"https://www.xda-developers.com/files/2022/05/IMG_2887-1024x768.jpg\" width=\"900\" /></a>\n<a href=\"https://www.xda-developers.com/files/2022/05/IMG_20220512_050707.jpg\"><img alt=\"Vivo X80 Pro, main camera\" class=\"attachment-large size-large\" height=\"675\" src=\"https://www.xda-developers.com/files/2022/05/IMG_20220512_050707-1024x768.jpg\" width=\"900\" /></a>\n\n<div class=\"quotecenter\">\n  <figure class=\"wp-block-pullquote quotestyle\">\n    <blockquote class=\"centerquotestyle\">\n      <p>Generally speaking, the Vivo X80 Pro shots are brighter and if we punch in, more detailed</p>\n    </blockquote>\n  </figure>\n</div>\n\n\n<p>When I <a href=\"https://www.xda-developers.com/apple-iphone-13-pro-review/\">reviewed the iPhone 13 Pro</a>/Pro Max (they have the exact same camera systems) last fall, I noticed the iPhone really struggled with exposure, often blowing out bright light sources in contrasty scenes, I think Apple&#8217;s software updates have since fixed the issues a bit, as the iPhone 13 Pro Max held up surprisingly well in the below shot shooting out the window into a sunny cityscape.

The Vivo X80 Pro cannot &#8212; if you begin filming with the main camera, then you can&#8217;t swap to the ultra-wide, and any zoom is digital zoom.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Still, the Vivo X80 Pro introduces a new &#8220;cinematic portrait&#8221; video mode and it is arguably as good as the iPhone 13 Pro Max&#8217;s own cinematic mode.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Overall, I&#8217;d say the Vivo X80 Pro&#8217;s camera system has a higher ceiling, but also a lower floor, meaning when the Vivo excels, it is very, very good, but there are some basic things like the ability to switch lenses while filming a video that Vivo still hasn&#8217;t gotten right. The iPhone 13 Pro Max is the more capable video camera and has a better telephoto zoom lens. But the differences are very narrow, and both are insanely amazing cameras that will not disappoint end users.</p>\n<hr />\n<h2>Apple iPhone 13 Pro Max vs Vivo X80 Pro: Software</h2>\n<p>This is yet another iOS vs Android showdown, and I think most readers have their opinions set already. But here&#8217;s my take: I have always preferred Android over iOS because the former is more customizable, and allows me to do more things (like <a href=\"https://www.xda-developers.com/how-to-sideload-install-android-app-apk/\">easily sideload apps</a>, or save files in a proper file system), but I am aware that iOS is more polished and is surrounded by a better hardware ecosystem and third-party app ecosystem.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\" id=\"attachment_650637\" style=\"width: 910px;\"><img alt=\"iPhone 13 Pro Max and Vivo X80 Pro\" class=\"size-large wp-image-650637\" height=\"600\" src=\"https://www.xda-developers.com/files/2022/06/DSC04555-1024x683.jpg\" width=\"900\" /><p class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-650637\">iOS 15 on the iPhone 13 Pro Max and FunTouch 12 on the Vivo X80 Pro.</p></div>\n<p>Those feelings definitely hold true for me while testing both of these phones side-by-side. Vivo&#8217;s FunTouch OS is highly customizable, allowing me to change animations for everything from the way the homescreen moves to fingerprint animations. I am also a fan of being able to open apps in floating windows which I do often. This latter part is a major reason why I carry an Android phone as my daily driver most of the time &#8212; I want to be able to multi-task on my phone. The iPhone 13 Pro Max, with that large screen, not being able to show more than one app at a time is frustrating.</p>\n\n<a href=\"https://www.xda-developers.com/files/2022/06/Screenshot_20220516_175220.jpg\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"attachment-large size-large\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https://www.xda-developers.com/files/2022/06/Screenshot_20220516_175220-461x1024.jpg\" width=\"461\" /></a>\n<a href=\"https://www.xda-developers.com/files/2022/06/Screenshot_20220601_161356.jpg\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"attachment-large size-large\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https://www.xda-developers.com/files/2022/06/Screenshot_20220601_161356-461x1024.jpg\" width=\"461\" /></a>\n<a href=\"https://www.xda-developers.com/files/2022/06/Screenshot_20220601_161403.jpg\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"attachment-large size-large\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https://www.xda-developers.com/files/2022/06/Screenshot_20220601_161403-461x1024.jpg\" width=\"461\" /></a>\n<a href=\"https://www.xda-developers.com/files/2022/06/Screenshot_20220601_161423.jpg\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"attachment-large size-large\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https://www.xda-developers.com/files/2022/06/Screenshot_20220601_161423-461x1024.jpg\" width=\"461\" /></a>\n<a href=\"https://www.xda-developers.com/files/2022/03/IMG_3461.jpg\"><img alt=\"oneui screenshot\" class=\"attachment-large size-large\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https://www.xda-developers.com/files/2022/03/IMG_3461-474x1024.jpg\" width=\"474\" /></a>\n<a href=\"https://www.xda-developers.com/files/2020/10/IMG_8597.jpg\"><img alt=\"iOS Smart Stack displaying Spotify music suggestions\" class=\"attachment-large size-large\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https://www.xda-developers.com/files/2020/10/IMG_8597-473x1024.jpg\" width=\"473\" /></a>\n<a href=\"https://www.xda-developers.com/files/2020/10/IMG_8598.jpg\"><img alt=\"iOS Smart Stack displaying shortcuts to send a Twitter DM or message a Facebook friend\" class=\"attachment-large size-large\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https://www.xda-developers.com/files/2020/10/IMG_8598-473x1024.jpg\" width=\"473\" /></a>\n<a href=\"https://www.xda-developers.com/files/2020/11/IMG_8732.jpg\"><img alt=\"iOS homescreen\" class=\"attachment-large size-large\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https://www.xda-developers.com/files/2020/11/IMG_8732-473x1024.jpg\" width=\"473\" /></a>\n\n<p>However, iOS being surrounded by a more polished ecosystem is something Android and Vivo still haven&#8217;t been able to match. I&#8217;m not just talking about synergy with other Apple devices, like the way I can record a voice memo on an iPhone and that same clip shows up on my iPad in a few seconds, or that I can access my MacBook&#8217;s homescreen files directly on the iPhone &#8212; those are all awesome features but require you to buy more Apple hardware. But even if you don&#8217;t own any other Apple hardware, you still benefit from getting better app support on an iPhone than on an Android phone. This isn&#8217;t that noticeable if you use only the most popular, globally-used apps &#8212; Facebook and Twitter will run just as well on Android as an iPhone. But if you use smaller regional apps, like say a banking app for Hong Kong, or a hotel check-in app in Singapore, or a taxi-hailing app in Italy, there&#8217;s a <em>high chance</em> the iOS version of the app runs much better.</p>\n<div class=\"quotecenter\">\n  <figure class=\"wp-block-pullquote quotestyle\">\n    <blockquote class=\"centerquotestyle\">\n      <p>iOS being surrounded by a more polished eco-system is something Android and Vivo still haven't been able to match</p>\n    </blockquote>\n  </figure>\n</div>\n\n\n<p>This means that even though my main SIM card is in an Android phone most of the year, I always have an iPhone nearby because of the superior app situation. And this is unlikely to be changing in the short term future.</p>\n<hr />\n<h2>Apple iPhone 13 Pro Max vs Vivo X80 Pro: Performance and Battery Life</h2>\n<p>It&#8217;s been well documented that the Apple A15 Bionic chip in the iPhone 13 Pro Max is a more powerful chip than the Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Gen 1 in the Vivo X80 Pro, and the benchmark numbers back that up again here. But the thing is, the <a href=\"https://www.xda-developers.com/qualcomm-snapdragon-8-gen-1/\">Snapdragon 8 Gen 1</a> is <em>still a very powerful</em>\u00a0silicon, so for most of my day-to-day usage, I don&#8217;t really see a difference in performance, it&#8217;s not like the iPhone 13 Pro Max was launching apps faster or able to process voice commands faster.</p>\n\n<a href=\"https://www.xda-developers.com/files/2022/06/IMG_4858.jpg\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"attachment-large size-large\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https://www.xda-developers.com/files/2022/06/IMG_4858-474x1024.jpg\" width=\"474\" /></a>\n<a href=\"https://www.xda-developers.com/files/2022/05/Screenshot_20220516_052123.jpg\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"attachment-large size-large\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https://www.xda-developers.com/files/2022/05/Screenshot_20220516_052123-461x1024.jpg\" width=\"461\" /></a>\n<a href=\"https://www.xda-developers.com/files/2022/06/IMG_C5FCD2E86029-1.jpeg\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"attachment-large size-large\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https://www.xda-developers.com/files/2022/06/IMG_C5FCD2E86029-1-474x1024.jpeg\" width=\"474\" /></a>\n<a href=\"https://www.xda-developers.com/files/2022/05/Screenshot_20220515_190701.jpg\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"attachment-large size-large\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https://www.xda-developers.com/files/2022/05/Screenshot_20220515_190701-461x1024.jpg\" width=\"461\" /></a>\n\n<p>Where I do notice is editing videos &#8212; I shoot a lot of video clips and I usually give the clips a quick trim and occasional crop (directly in the phone&#8217;s native photo gallery app) before I upload to Instagram, and the rendering process is instantaneous most of the time on an iPhone 13 Pro Max, but would require a 10-second wait on the Vivo X80 Pro. Likewise, when I&#8217;m exporting 360 videos via Insta360&#8217;s app, the process is much faster on an iPhone than on any <a href=\"https://www.xda-developers.com/best-android-phones/\">2022 Android flagship</a> too.</p>\n<div class=\"quotecenter\">\n  <figure class=\"wp-block-pullquote quotestyle\">\n    <blockquote class=\"centerquotestyle\">\n      <p>The Apple A15 Bionic chip is more powerful than the Snapdragon 8 Gen 1, but you won't notice it in most daily tasks</p>\n    </blockquote>\n  </figure>\n</div>\n\n\n<p>Other general performance areas favor the iPhone too: Apple&#8217;s device has a louder, fuller speaker setup, better haptics, and better battery life. In fact, the iPhone 13 Pro Max has probably the best battery life of any phone I&#8217;ve tested in the last couple of years &#8212; I can finish entire 12-, 13-hour days with well over 30% of juice to spare. No Android flagship phone in the 120Hz screen era has been able to achieve this. Still, the Vivo X80 Pro is usually able to last a full 12-13 hour day too (just with less battery left at the end), so this isn&#8217;t really a big deal to me. Whether I make it home with 32% or 17% battery left doesn&#8217;t really matter that much. Plus, the Vivo X80 Pro can charge much faster and the charger is included, so those are solid wins.</p>\n<hr />\n<h2>Apple iPhone 13 Pro Max vs Vivo X80 Pro: Which phone is better?</h2>\n<p>If you&#8217;re keeping score at home, I got the Vivo X80 Pro winning in photography, software in terms of productivity, and display immersion for viewing content. But the iPhone 13 Pro Max is a better video camera, has better battery life, and is more powerful for intensive tasks like heavy gaming or editing/rendering videos.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"iphone 13 pro max and vivo x80 pro\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-650623\" height=\"600\" src=\"https://www.xda-developers.com/files/2022/06/DSC04054-1024x683.jpg\" width=\"900\" /></p>\n<p>There&#8217;s also the value factor, which is arguably a win for Vivo: both the iPhone 13 Pro Max and the Vivo X80 Pro are priced at roughly the $1,100 range in most parts of the world, but Vivo&#8217;s phone comes with a screen protector, a nice faux-leather case, wired earbuds, and a fast charger. In regions like India, the difference between the iPhone 13 Pro Max and the Vivo X80 Pro goes above $640 (~$750 if you compare the 256GB variants), at which point, the Vivo X80 Pro just wins hands down for pure value.</p>\n<p>But ultimately, this entire versus piece is mostly an exercise for enthusiasts or the curious, because the reality is iOS users are likely not going to jump to Android on a whim, and the iPhone 13 Pro Max is a much easier purchase for major chunks of the world including the US. But still, if you are on the market for a new phone and the Vivo X80 Pro is available in your area, you can at least know you&#8217;re getting a tip-top premium Android phone with the best still photo camera around.</p>\n<div class=\"nanobox-topofpage\">\n<div class=\"xda_nanobox\">\n<ul class=\"nanobox-title\">\n  <a href=\"https://shop-links.co/1768337731120597860?u1=de471a19-7610-43b6-beed-843fe5b076d2\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><h4 class=\"nanobox-product-title\">Apple iPhone 13 Pro Max</h4></a>\n</ul>\n<div class=\"nanobox-col-md-4 nanobox-col-sm-6\">\n  <ul class=\"nanobox-reco-features-image\">\n<a href=\"https://shop-links.co/1768337731120597860?u1=de471a19-7610-43b6-beed-843fe5b076d2\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"Apple iPhone 13 Pro Max\" class=\"wp-image-10741 nano-img\" src=\"https://www.xda-developers.com/files/2021/09/iphone-13-pro-max.jpg\" width=\"213\" /></a>\n  </ul>\n     </div>\n<div class=\"nanobox-col-md-8 nanobox-col-sm-6\">\n<ul class=\"nanobox-recodesc\">\nThe iPhone 13 Pro Max is the biggest and baddest Apple has to offer in the mobile space.

It remains one of the best wearables available out there and continues to blow our minds with each annual upgrade. What makes solid hardware so great is rich software that utilizes the internals and makes the most out of their power &#8212; efficiently. This is what makes software updates so exciting. Every year, we receive a major set of new features that give our same watches a new life to them. They feel brand new, thanks to the refreshed software elements and introduced additions. To get your hands on the latest features, you can easily <a href=\"https://www.xda-developers.com/how-to-install-watchos-beta/\">install watchOS beta</a> builds. However, the important question is &#8212; should you? Here&#8217;s what you need to know.</p>\n<p>We get it, trying out new features can be very tempting. That comes with risks, though &#8212; especially in Apple Watch&#8217;s case. That&#8217;s because if the beta version is too unstable or buggy, you can&#8217;t roll back to a stable build without visiting an Apple Store or authorized repair center. So you will remain stuck on beta until Apple releases a newer, stable build. That&#8217;s not to mention that some beta updates can brick your watch. While you can <a href=\"https://www.xda-developers.com/how-to-restore-apple-watch-iphone/\">restore it with an iPhone</a>, sometimes this method doesn&#8217;t work. In that case, you&#8217;d have to get it repaired at an authorized place.</p>\n<p>So should you install the watchOS beta? If there&#8217;s an authorized repair center where you reside, then the risk isn&#8217;t as big. That&#8217;s because you can just get it fixed if things go wrong. However, if you can&#8217;t repair in your region, then the wiser decision would be to refrain from switching to beta. Nobody wants to travel just for the sake of reviving a dead Apple Watch &#8212; I think.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s also worth pointing out that even if you don&#8217;t brick your watch on beta, some features might still not work. If you religiously depend on your Apple Watch in your day-to-day life, a smart idea would be to stick to stable watchOS. Now that you know the risks, you can evaluate and decide accordingly.</p>\n<div class=\"nanobox-topofpage\">\n<div class=\"xda_nanobox\">\n<ul class=\"nanobox-title\">\n  <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Apple-Watch-Midnight-Aluminum-Sport/dp/B09HF6XBPF/?tag=xdadev04-20\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><h4 class=\"nanobox-product-title\">Apple Watch Series 7</h4></a>\n</ul>\n<div class=\"nanobox-col-md-4 nanobox-col-sm-6\">\n  <ul class=\"nanobox-reco-features-image\">\n<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Apple-Watch-Midnight-Aluminum-Sport/dp/B09HF6XBPF/?tag=xdadev04-20\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"Apple Watch Series 7\" class=\"wp-image-10741 nano-img\" src=\"https://www.xda-developers.com/files/2021/10/ML783_VW_34FRwatch-45-stainless-silver-cell-7s_VW_34FR_WF_CO.jpeg\" width=\"213\" /></a>\n  </ul>\n     </div>\n<div class=\"nanobox-col-md-8 nanobox-col-sm-6\">\n<ul class=\"nanobox-recodesc\">\nThe Apple Watch Series 7 has a larger display and a more rugged frame compared to its predecessor.\n</ul>\n  <ul class=\"nanobox-product-cta\">\n<a class=\"button\" href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Apple-Watch-Midnight-Aluminum-Sport/dp/B09HF6XBPF/?tag=xdadev04-20\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><span class=\"xda_btn-content\">View at Amazon</span><i class=\"icon fa fa-arrow-right\"></i></a>                                                                                                            </ul>\n</div>\n  </div>\n\t  </div>\n<div style=\"clear: both;\"></div>\n\n\n<p><em>Will you be installing watchOS beta on your Apple Watch?

It&#8217;s easy to install <a href=\"https://www.xda-developers.com/?p=647815&amp;preview=true\">iPadOS beta</a>\u00a0to try out Apple&#8217;s latest additions to the platform. Though, is it wise to do so? New features can indeed be tempting. However, pre-release builds can be riddled with bugs and unexpected behavior. Here&#8217;s our advice to you.</p>\n<p>Unlike the Apple Watch, downgrading to a stable build in an iPad is relatively easy and doable at home. So if you dislike the iPadOS beta experience, you can switch back to the stable version of the OS. So you can at least try the beta out and decide if it&#8217;s for you or not &#8212; assuming you know what you&#8217;re doing. If this sounds all confusing to you, it&#8217;s smart to avoid beta OS builds.</p>\n<p>Additionally, if you use your iPad for work or studies, it&#8217;s not the greatest idea to enroll it in the beta program. Apps and core features could glitch or break completely. If your iPad is just a media consumption or entertainment device, then perhaps there&#8217;s no harm in running iPadOS beta on it. Ultimately the decision isn&#8217;t permanent, and you could always undo it if you change your mind with the help of a computer.</p>\n<p>Personally, I&#8217;ve been running iPadOS beta builds on my daily driver for the longest time. I&#8217;ve never encountered any deal-breaking bugs so far. Sometimes the battery life takes a hit or the user interface of some system elements glitch &#8212; nothing too extreme, in my opinion. If you seek a polished operating system, then definitely avoid the beta.</p>\n<div class=\"nanobox-topofpage\">\n<div class=\"xda_nanobox\">\n<ul class=\"nanobox-title\">\n  <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/2022-Apple-iPad-10-9-inch-Wi-Fi/dp/B09V3HN1KC?tag=xdadev04-20\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><h4 class=\"nanobox-product-title\">Apple iPad Air 5 (2022)</h4></a>\n</ul>\n<div class=\"nanobox-col-md-4 nanobox-col-sm-6\">\n  <ul class=\"nanobox-reco-features-image\">\n<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/2022-Apple-iPad-10-9-inch-Wi-Fi/dp/B09V3HN1KC?tag=xdadev04-20\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"Apple iPad Air 5 (2022)\" class=\"wp-image-10741 nano-img\" src=\"https://www.xda-developers.com/files/2022/03/iPad-Air-5-Space-Grey.png\" width=\"213\" /></a>\n  </ul>\n     </div>\n<div class=\"nanobox-col-md-8 nanobox-col-sm-6\">\n<ul class=\"nanobox-recodesc\">\nThe new 5th-generation iPad Air is powered by the Apple M1 processor.

The number of problems I faced when switching to an iPhone really drove the point home to me, and there have been several issues with iOS over the years &#8212; some of which are completely nonsensical. While Apple prides itself on creating the phone that just works, there are some elements of that experience that are downright confusing. iOS 16 is just around the corner, and it&#8217;s almost certain it won&#8217;t fix all of the iPhone&#8217;s problems.</p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s the thing though: the number of issues Apple has in iOS can <em>technically\u00a0</em>all be fixed in iOS 16. It&#8217;s just that they almost certainly will not be. Terrible notifications, slow animations, and an inflexible home screen all frustrate me to no end, but there&#8217;s more to it than that. iOS as an operating system &#8220;just works&#8221;, but that mantra is flawed when it comes to several aspects. There&#8217;s a lot that <a href=\"https://www.xda-developers.com/wwdc22-wishlist-ios-16-features/\">we&#8217;re hoping to see in iOS 16</a>, but we&#8217;re almost guaranteed not to get much of it at all.</p>\n<hr />\n<h2>Problems with iOS</h2>\n<h3>Notifications need a major overhaul</h3>\n<p>Notifications are probably the most universally understood problem of iOS, and there are several reasons why. They feel like an afterthought when using an iPhone, and there&#8217;s a lot of work needed to make them significantly better. iOS 15 introduced &#8220;summaries&#8221;, which went a long way towards helping the situation, but they&#8217;re in no way a solution.</p>\n\n<a href=\"https://www.xda-developers.com/files/2022/06/iOS-15-Notification-Clear-All-Watermarked.jpg\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"attachment-large size-large\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https://www.xda-developers.com/files/2022/06/iOS-15-Notification-Clear-All-Watermarked-474x1024.jpg\" width=\"474\" /></a>\n<a href=\"https://www.xda-developers.com/files/2022/06/iOS-15-Notification-Quick-Actions-Watermarked.jpg\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"attachment-large size-large\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https://www.xda-developers.com/files/2022/06/iOS-15-Notification-Quick-Actions-Watermarked-474x1024.jpg\" width=\"474\" /></a>\n<a href=\"https://www.xda-developers.com/files/2022/06/iOS-15-Notification-Extra-Options-Watermarked.jpg\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"attachment-large size-large\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https://www.xda-developers.com/files/2022/06/iOS-15-Notification-Extra-Options-Watermarked-474x1024.jpg\" width=\"474\" /></a>\n<a href=\"https://www.xda-developers.com/files/2022/06/iOS-15-Notification-Long-Press-Watermarked.jpg\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"attachment-large size-large\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https://www.xda-developers.com/files/2022/06/iOS-15-Notification-Long-Press-Watermarked-474x1024.jpg\" width=\"474\" /></a>\n\n<p>When comparing iOS notifications to Android, it&#8217;s really no comparison. On Android, from a notification, you can open the app, long press to change the notification&#8217;s priority, dismiss it by swiping in either direction or expand it to get additional contextual-based interactions. You can respond to messages, send pre-defined actions, and a whole lot more. iOS has the basic functionality of opening the notification or being able to swipe it away to the left, but try to swipe it to the right and you&#8217;ll have a problem. Some apps do allow you to hold down on a notification and get additional functionality, but those tend to just extend into opening the app in a particular way.</p>\n<p>There are other problems with notifications on iOS too, including being able to clear all of your notifications away. It\u00a0<em>can</em> be done by tapping on the &#8216;x&#8217; button in the notifications center and tapping it again, but that doesn&#8217;t\u00a0<em>always</em> show up, and it doesn&#8217;t clear your most recent notifications either. Notifications work on iPhones, but there are a lot of problems and things that need polishing, and it seems to be a rather universal experience. The notifications system in iOS needs a major overhaul.</p>\n<p>To be clear, <a href=\"https://www.xda-developers.com/ios-16-could-support-lock-screen-widgets-more/\">rumors suggest</a> that there is going to be an overhaul of the notification system with iOS 16. As a result, this may be one of the few issues that Apple actually does do something about. Here&#8217;s hoping for the best.</p>\n<h3>Siri is ten years out of date</h3>\n<p>The craziest thing about Siri to me is how outdated it has become. I remember when it launched with the iPhone 4s how insanely ahead of the competition it felt. You could talk to a virtual assistant and ask it anything, from genuinely useful queries to silly questions such as &#8220;Siri, what&#8217;s the meaning of life&#8221;. Now, whenever I use Siri, it feels like I&#8217;m using the same software from ten years ago. It&#8217;s just faster.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"Siri WWDC 2022\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-651695\" height=\"632\" src=\"https://www.xda-developers.com/files/2022/06/Siri-WWDC-2022-Watermarked-1024x719.jpg\" width=\"900\" /></p>\n<p>Siri is Apple&#8217;s long-time voice assistant, and it&#8217;s also incredibly useless for any complicated task. The Google Assistant simply fares a whole lot better, and a large part of that is thanks to the context that Google Assistant actually understands. For example, I asked Siri what the weather was like in Dublin. I then asked when is it expected to rain, and it told me that it was raining in my <em>hometown</em> right now. In context, I asked Google the same, and it understood that I was asking about rain in Dublin still. It&#8217;s the little things like this that show just how far behind Siri actually is.</p>\n<p>Those aren&#8217;t the only problems though. If you ask Siri a question that would be Google-able, say, when the Bob&#8217;s Burgers movie will be released, you&#8217;ll be presented with a list of links to go through and select from. I asked Google the same question, and was told &#8220;In the United States of America, the Bob&#8217;s Burgers movie came out last Friday&#8221;. It&#8217;s the little things, but a virtual assistant should\u00a0<em>assist</em>. If I&#8217;m asking an assistant to find a date for me, I don&#8217;t want to sift through a bunch of links to find the answer like some kind of <em>animal</em>. I could have just Googled it myself at that point.</p>\n<p>So yeah, currently, Siri still sucks.</p>\n<h3>The home screen is too restrictive</h3>\n<p>The home screen is one of the least egregious issues that I have with iOS, and that&#8217;s because it&#8217;s both really good, and really annoying. On the one hand, it&#8217;s simplistic and it works, and it&#8217;s a pretty good launcher all things considered. It&#8217;s smooth, the widgets are good (though took a LONG TIME to actually release), and it&#8217;s feature-packed. On the other hand, there are still quite a few issues. For starters, the fact it&#8217;s not possible to have blank spaces anywhere on the home screen is incredibly annoying. It&#8217;s just not possible to take a more artistic approach to the home screen without resorting to workarounds.</p>\n\n<a href=\"https://www.xda-developers.com/files/2022/06/iOS-15-Home-Screen-1-Watermarked.jpg\"><img alt=\"iOS 15 home screen\" class=\"attachment-large size-large\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https://www.xda-developers.com/files/2022/06/iOS-15-Home-Screen-1-Watermarked-474x1024.jpg\" width=\"474\" /></a>\n<a href=\"https://www.xda-developers.com/files/2022/06/iOS-15-Home-Screen-2-Watermarked.jpg\"><img alt=\"iOS 15 home screen\" class=\"attachment-large size-large\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https://www.xda-developers.com/files/2022/06/iOS-15-Home-Screen-2-Watermarked-474x1024.jpg\" width=\"474\" /></a>\n\n<p>As well, widgets themselves are incredibly limited. As we noted in our wishlist, there are no\u00a0<em>interactive</em> widgets. You can\u2019t use the Music widget to pause/play/skip, for example. This makes them so limiting \u2014 especially since the legacy widgets support controlling an app or getting info without launching the actual app. Rumors suggest some changes to widgets in iOS 16, but none say that we&#8217;ll get proper interactivity.</p>\n<h3>There is no universal back gesture</h3>\n<p>Here&#8217;s a curious omission on iOS that you might not have necessarily realized: there is no universal back gesture. While every app generally has a way to swipe from left to right to go back, it&#8217;s up to the app how it wants to incorporate back gestures. Some apps will only let you swipe back at the top, others require you to press a back button at the top left.</p>\n<p>As a result, a lot of apps tend to have it slightly different, and pretty much no app allows you to swipe from right to left to go back, something that&#8217;s way more convenient when holding the phone in your right hand. On Android, this isn&#8217;t the case, as a swipe on the right or the left is handled by the system and sent as an input to the app to say that you want to go back.</p>\n<h3>Animations are too slow</h3>\n<p><div class=\"quoteright\">\n  <figure class=\"wp-block-pullquote pullrightstyle\">\n    <blockquote class=\"rightquotestyle\">\n      <p>iOS has some extremely slow animations</p>\n    </blockquote>\n  </figure>\n</div>\n\niOS has some extremely slow animations, to the point that I feel like they slow down my phone. Closing apps, opening apps, animations within apps&#8230; all of it feels so\u00a0<em>slow</em>. The Apple Bionic A15 can handle all of it no question, yet it&#8217;s frustrating to use my iPhone when I want to jump between different applications quickly. It&#8217;s a smaller gripe, but one that can sometimes get on my nerves. You can enable &#8220;Reduce motion&#8221; in the accessibility settings, but I didn&#8217;t really find that it increased the\u00a0<em>speed</em> I could do things on my phone.</p>\n<h3>It&#8217;s still not really possible to sideload apps</h3>\n<p>It would be amiss to talk about problems with iOS without mentioning sideloading. It&#8217;s possible to do <a href=\"https://www.xda-developers.com/how-to-sideload-apps-on-iphone/\">through the likes of AltStore</a>, but it&#8217;s not an easy process. To use emulators and other unapproved apps on your smartphone, you\u2019ll need to install and configure AltStore\u2026 you can\u2019t just download an IPA file (the iPhone equivalent of an APK) and install it. I never realized how much I appreciated that freedom until I was faced with a lengthy and annoying process just to play Pokemon on my phone. I don&#8217;t think this will ever be changed, but I&#8217;d love it so much if it was.</p>\n<h3>Typing should be easier</h3>\n<p>Given that smartphones are smartphones, typing is one of the most important things we do on our phones. As a result, it should probably be the most frictionless experience of the entire ordeal, but on iPhones, I can&#8217;t really say that it is.</p>\n<p>One of the most irksome parts of typing is when something is autocorrected by a letter, and to fix it, you can&#8217;t just tap into the center of the word to change it. You either need to backspace through the word or tap to the end of it, then hold on to the space bar and drag. It&#8217;s such a bizarre way to make minor edits and can take way too long.</p>\n<p>As well, and this is more of a personal preference, but I hate that I can type a message and the last letter is auto-corrected\u00a0in between me hitting enter, and the message actually being sent.</p>\n<hr />\n<h2>What to expect in iOS 16 and when</h2>\n<p>iOS 16 is expected to arrive at this year&#8217;s Apple\u2019s Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC), and we&#8217;ve already heard a lot of rumors of what to expect thanks to\u00a0<em>Bloomberg&#8217;s</em> Mark Gurman. Gurman purports that Apple will finally introduce support for lock screen widgets \u2014 through a new wallpaper format \u2014 and bring in an always-on display on upcoming iPhone 14 Pro models. Furthermore, he states that he believes that Apple will support social network-like features in the Messages app.</p>\n<p>WWDC is only a week away, so we don&#8217;t have long to wait until we find out what&#8217;s new and what isn&#8217;t. While iOS has a lot of issues, I think that it&#8217;s still a good operating system, and improvements and changes are good for the entire smartphone ecosystem.</p>\n<p>We&#8217;re excited, are you?</p>\n<p class=\"clear:both;\">\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://www.xda-developers.com/editorial-ios-16-fix-iphone-problems/\" rel=\"nofollow\">iOS 16 can&#8217;t fix all of Apple&#8217;s iPhone problems</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://www.xda-developers.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">XDA</a>.</p>"}], "wfw_commentrss": "https://www.xda-developers.com/editorial-ios-16-fix-iphone-problems/feed/", "slash_comments": "0", "published_js": "2022-06-04"}, {"title": "Browservio is a speedy WebView-based browser with a built-in ad blocker", "title_detail": {"type": "text/plain", "language": null, "base": "https://www.xda-developers.com/feed/", "value": "Browservio is a speedy WebView-based browser with a built-in ad blocker"}, "links": [{"rel": "alternate", "type": "text/html", "href": "https://www.xda-developers.com/browservio-webview-browser/"}, {"href": "https://www.xda-developers.com/files/2022/05/Browservio-logo-featured.jpg", "rel": "enclosure"}], "link": "https://www.xda-developers.com/browservio-webview-browser/", "comments": "https://www.xda-developers.com/browservio-webview-browser/#respond", "authors": [{"name": "Skanda Hazarika"}], "author": "Skanda Hazarika", "author_detail": {"name": "Skanda Hazarika"}, "published": "Sat, 04 Jun 2022 14:00:17 +0000", "published_parsed": [2022, 6, 4, 14, 0, 17, 5, 155, 0], "tags": [{"term": "Forum Links", "scheme": null, "label": null}, {"term": "Mods", "scheme": null, "label": null}, {"term": "News Brief", "scheme": null, "label": null}, {"term": "android apps", "scheme": null, "label": null}, {"term": "browser", "scheme": null, "label": null}, {"term": "WebView", "scheme": null, "label": null}], "id": "https://www.xda-developers.com/?p=631225", "guidislink": false, "summary": "<p>One of the great things about Android is the ability to choose a different default browser.

Not only is the app free and open-source, but it also uses Android&#8217;s built-in WebView component as its backend to keep the footprint low.</p>\n<p>On any modern Android version, the WebView module is automatically updated through the Play Store. Of course, there are a few differences between a WebView wrapper and a browser written on the foundation of Chromium&#8217;s Blink engine, but you probably won&#8217;t be able to tell. Browservio isn&#8217;t merely a wrapper, though, as it has all the essentials for a regular user. You can turn on the desktop view for individual sites, opt for tabbed browsing, and even switch between light and dark modes. Ad blocking and the Do Not Track features are also available.</p>\n\n<a href=\"https://www.xda-developers.com/files/2022/05/Browservio-main-page.jpg\"><img alt=\"Browservio main page\" class=\"attachment-full size-full\" height=\"867\" src=\"https://www.xda-developers.com/files/2022/05/Browservio-main-page.jpg\" width=\"400\" /></a>\n<a href=\"https://www.xda-developers.com/files/2022/05/Browservio-options.jpg\"><img alt=\"Browservio options\" class=\"attachment-full size-full\" height=\"867\" src=\"https://www.xda-developers.com/files/2022/05/Browservio-options.jpg\" width=\"400\" /></a>\n<a href=\"https://www.xda-developers.com/files/2022/05/Browservio-about.jpg\"><img alt=\"Browservio about\" class=\"attachment-full size-full\" height=\"867\" src=\"https://www.xda-developers.com/files/2022/05/Browservio-about.jpg\" width=\"400\" /></a>\n\n<p>Browservio packs in quite a few advanced features as well.

The company unveiled the Pixel Watch during the I/O Developer keynote on May 11, giving us our first official look at the watch that <a href=\"https://www.xda-developers.com/real-world-images-google-pixel-watch-leak/\">someone left at a restaurant</a> earlier this year. The Pixel Watch is arriving after years of supposed leaks, rumors, delays, and cancellations. So without any further buildup, let&#8217;s put together everything we know about the Google Pixel Watch in one place to see how it&#8217;s shaping up.</p>\n<p>Before we begin, it&#8217;s worth mentioning that we&#8217;re also including leaks and rumors in this article in addition to the official info that&#8217;s already out there. Not everything that you&#8217;re about to read is official unless mentioned otherwise. We&#8217;ll add more details to this page over time as we get closer to the launch day, so keep your eyes peeled.</p>\n<p><strong>Navigate this article:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.xda-developers.com/feed/#pricing\">Pricing &amp; Availability</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.xda-developers.com/feed/#specifications\">Specifications</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.xda-developers.com/feed/#design\">Design</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.xda-developers.com/feed/#software\">Software</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.xda-developers.com/feed/#wishlist\">Google Pixel Watch wishlist</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"pricing\">Google Pixel Watch: Pricing &amp; Availability</h2>\n<p>Word on the street is that the Pixel Watch could be priced in the range of $300 to $400. That would put it in the same league as some other popular smartwatches on the market including the <a href=\"https://www.xda-developers.com/apple-watch-series-7-review/\">Apple Watch Series 7</a>, the <a href=\"https://www.xda-developers.com/samsung-galaxy-watch-4-classic-review/\">Galaxy Watch 4</a>, and more. There&#8217;s no official confirmation on this just yet, so we&#8217;ll have to wait for the announcement to see if that will be the case. Google also appears to be cooking as many as <a href=\"https://www.xda-developers.com/google-pixel-watch-fcc-listings-lte-model-usb-c-cable/\">three Pixel Watch models</a> with different connectivity options. According to the FCC website, one of the models offers Bluetooth and Wi-Fi connectivity, while the others have LTE support as well.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"A person wearing the Pixel Watch on the left hand while holding a Pixel with both hands\" class=\"size-large wp-image-648257 aligncenter\" height=\"600\" src=\"https://www.xda-developers.com/files/2022/05/Google-Pixel-Watch-1-1-1024x683.jpg\" width=\"900\" /></p>\n<p>Google has confirmed that it&#8217;s launching the Pixel Watch in the fall. It makes complete sense to bring both the watch and the new phones to the market together. If the past events are something to go by, then we would guess that the Pixel Watch will launch alongside the Pixel 7 family in October. We&#8217;ll see if the Pixel Watch will be available to purchase in all major markets worldwide. Google has a habit of limiting its Pixel phones to only a handful of markets, although that could change with the Pixel Watch.</p>\n<h2 id=\"specifications\">Google Pixel Watch: Specifications</h2>\n<p>We didn&#8217;t get to hear a whole lot about the Pixel Watch in terms of the specs. Google is saving those details for the launch later in the fall. Some early reports suggest that the <a href=\"https://www.xda-developers.com/google-pixel-watch-older-chipset/\">Pixel Watch may pack the Exynos 9110</a>, a relatively old chipset, along with 1.5GB of memory and 32GB of storage. The Exynos 9110 is built on a 10nm process, packing two Cortex-A53 cores. It&#8217;s more efficient than Qualcomm&#8217;s latest chipset for wearables, which means it could pair nicely with the <a href=\"https://www.xda-developers.com/google-pixel-watch-battery-and-connectivity-details-emerge/\">rumored 300 mAh battery</a>. Qualcomm&#8217;s Snapdragon Wear 4100 Plus, however, isn&#8217;t exactly a benchmark for comparison.</p>\n<p>The Pixel Watch needs to be better than Samsung&#8217;s Galaxy Watch 4 or even the rumored Galaxy Watch 5, which is expected to launch sometime before Google&#8217;s offering. The Galaxy Watch 5 is said to pack at minimum, an Exynos W920, which is likely to beat the Exynos 9110. All this is just speculation for now, and it&#8217;s best to reserve our judgments for later. It is worth mentioning that the FCC listing says the Pixel Watch will have a USB-C charging cable. It&#8217;s said to come with the same magnetic charging puck that we have seen on the Galaxy Watch 4 and other watches, with a USB-C port on the other end of the cable. As for the battery life, it looks like the <a href=\"https://www.xda-developers.com/google-pixel-watch-charge-time-battery-life-report/\">Pixel Watch will have single-day battery life</a>. It&#8217;s an estimate that Google is said to have made internally, although it remains to be seen whether or not it accounts for an always-on display and sleep tracking feature.</p>\n<p>Google didn&#8217;t tell us much about the Watch during the I/O 2022 keynote. It&#8217;s probably for the best because the watch itself isn&#8217;t going to ship before the fall. We&#8217;ll update this section with a fully fleshed-out specifications table once we have enough information to fill it up.</p>\n<h2 id=\"design\">Google Pixel Watch: Design</h2>\n<p></p>\n<p>Google has already given us our first official look at its upcoming smartwatch during the I/O 2022 keynote, leaving nothing about the design to our imagination. There have also been numerous leaks leading up to the keynote, so it&#8217;s safe to assume that we have a very good idea of what the Pixel Watch looks like. It has a circular face that almost looks like it&#8217;s floating above the bands. Google calls it a &#8220;domed&#8221; design on its website. You can also see a button on the right side of the device along with the crown for navigating through the UI.</p>\n<p>In terms of the color options, we&#8217;ve seen models with black, gray, and gold casings so far with black, gray, and lime green color bands. Google hasn&#8217;t revealed if it&#8217;s using aluminum or steel, but we may see both options. We suspect the Pixel Watch also uses proprietary bands, meaning you might not be able to use standard watch bands. The bands we&#8217;ve so far in the renders appear to be using high-quality rubber material, but we expect Google to actively release new ones for the watch.</p>\n<p>As you can probably tell, the round display of the watch seems to have big bezels. You can see them only in some of the renders because Google has done a pretty good job of masking them by using a clock face with dark background in almost all of its press renders. Here&#8217;s a GIF image in which you can gauge the size of those bezels. Google didn&#8217;t tell us the size of the display, and neither about the different sizes of the Pixel Watch.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"\" class=\"aligncenter\" height=\"270\" src=\"https://media.giphy.com/media/3qLpJeG5lFtkn8YT4A/giphy.gif\" width=\"480\" /></p>\n<h2 id=\"software\">Google Pixel Watch: Software</h2>\n<p>According to Google&#8217;s Rick Osterloh, the Pixel Watch will come with an improved UI. It&#8217;s likely to have fluid animations and support a smarter way to interact with incoming notifications. Notably, the Pixel Watch will also have support for Google Assistant with which you&#8217;ll be able to get things done with your voice. It remains to be seen how helpful Google Assistant will be. An LTE-enabled version of the Pixel Watch was also shown running Google Maps on the stage during the keynote. We expect a lot of similar features to take advantage of the LTE connection to help you manage things better when you&#8217;re out and about without your phone.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"A person using Google Maps on a Pixel Watch \" class=\"size-large wp-image-648259 aligncenter\" height=\"600\" src=\"https://www.xda-developers.com/files/2022/05/Pixel-Wathc-with-Google-Maps-1024x683.jpg\" width=\"900\" /></p>\n<p>A lot of the Wear OS features supported by the Pixel Watch are still under the wraps but we expect to learn more about them in the coming weeks and months, leading up to the official release. We suggest you take a look at our <a href=\"https://www.xda-developers.com/wear-os-3-galaxy-watch-4-oneui-watch-review/\">Wear OS 3 review</a> to learn more about the features in detail, although the Pixel Watch experience could be fairly different from Samsung&#8217;s approach on the Galaxy Watch 4 series..</p>\n<p>Google&#8217;s Pixel Watch is also expected to have a strong footing in the health and fitness department. We don&#8217;t know much about the sensors at play here, but Google says this is going to be a great wearable for fitness tracking. This could be the watch that brings Fitbit&#8217;s class-leading tracking features to the mainstream market. We&#8217;ll also see the new <a href=\"https://www.xda-developers.com/google-samsung-health-connect-api/\">Health Connect API</a> playing a huge role in creating a vast ecosystem of products that work in tandem to bring rich experiences.</p>\n<h2 id=\"wishlist\">Google Pixel Watch: Wishlist</h2>\n<p>We&#8217;ve been hearing about Google&#8217;s first smartwatch ever since it rebranded Android Wear to Wear OS, so it&#8217;s safe to say that our expectations are set. Here&#8217;s our wishlist for the Google Pixel Watch:</p>\n<h3>Long-lasting battery</h3>\n<p>This one&#8217;s certainly on top of our Pixel Watch wishlist for some obvious reasons. The Samsung Galaxy Watch 4, for instance, can last you more than a day on a single charge. We expect the Pixel Watch to offer something along those lines or possibly even better. Being able to use the watch for more than a day with all the useful features would be great. We doubt if the rumored 300 mAh battery will be enough to pull it off, though. Continuing on the topic of battery, it would also be nice to have support for a universal charging method. We hope it uses Qi wireless charging and is also compatible with the <a href=\"https://www.xda-developers.com/google-pixel-stand-2nd-gen-built-in-fan-fast-charging-support/\">Pixel Stand accessory</a>.</p>\n<h3>Assistant voice typing</h3>\n<p>Google has confirmed that the Pixel Watch will be getting the Google Assistant when it comes out later this year. More than that, we want to see the Assistant voice typing feature on the Pixel Watch. Voice dictation is better &#8212; and smarter &#8212; than ever on the Pixel 6 and it works flawlessly. Having that killer feature would make the Pixel Watch that much better for responding to messages and emails without having to reach the phone. It could very well be the main reason why many would purchase the watch.</p>\n<h3>Sizable onboard storage</h3>\n<p>If you are someone who likes to download music, podcasts, and a lot of apps on your watch, then you&#8217;d probably need more storage than an average user. The Pixel Watch will likely have 32GB of onboard storage, which we think should be enough for all your needs. It&#8217;s higher than the Galaxy Watch 4&#8217;s 16GB of onboard storage and we think it should be enough to store large playlists of high-quality content, and other apps too.</p>\n<h3>Pixel feature drops for the Watch</h3>\n<p>There&#8217;s no doubt the Pixel Watch will have a\u00a0 ton of awesome features at launch. But we won&#8217;t stand against the idea of getting feature drops for the Pixel Watch, like the Pixel phones. Regular OTA updates with new features will certainly make the Pixel Watch better than the barrage of wearables out there. It may sound like wishful thinking considering this is Google&#8217;s first smartwatch, but the company also seems to have taken its sweet time to bring this watch to the market.</p>\n<h3>Google Pixel Watch &#8220;Sports Edition&#8221;?</h3>\n<p>The Pixel Watch is likely to have a lot of fitness tracking features. This is where we expect Google to turn to Fitbit&#8217;s expertise to deliver a quality health and fitness-focused smartwatch. But how about a dedicated sports edition watch for fitness enthusiasts? Perhaps a variant with a different strap design and more tracking features.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Well, that brings us to the end of our wishlist and also this article, for now. As we mentioned earlier, we&#8217;ll continue to update this page with fresh information as they become available to us. In the meantime, be sure to let us know what you&#8217;re looking forward to the most about the upcoming Pixel Watch.

It packed excellent performance, a decent camera, and a good software experience into one affordable package. To me, that&#8217;s the entire essence of what OnePlus is about. Now the company is back with a refreshed OnePlus Nord 2T, and it&#8217;s more of the same with some additional bits and subtle differences on top.</p>\n<p>Really, if you&#8217;re looking to pick up a solid mid-range smartphone and didn&#8217;t grab the Nord 2, then you should get the Nord 2T instead. If you <em>have</em> the OnePlus Nord 2, then you definitely aren&#8217;t missing out. As we identified in our review of the OnePlus 10 Pro, the difference between the 65W charger and the 80W charger is negligible at best, and that&#8217;s the &#8220;biggest upgrade&#8221; here.</p>\n<p>The MediaTek Dimensity 1300 is basically the same on the surface as the Dimensity 1200 from what we could gather and even using the devices side-by-side, the screens seem practically identical. Basically, the bottom line is that if you have a OnePlus Nord 2, then don&#8217;t feel jaded or as if you&#8217;re missing out: you really aren&#8217;t. However, the Nord 2 did set the bar pretty high, and the Nord 2T maintains that, marking it as an excellent smartphone for the price if you need a new one.</p>\n<div class=\"xda_productboxtopofpage\">\n<div class=\"box productbox\">\n<ul class=\"product-title\">\n  <a href=\"https://xda.link/to/hM1CDG1r7\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><h4 class=\"reco-product-title\">OnePlus Nord 2T</h4></a>\n</ul>\n<div class=\"col-md-4 col-sm-6\">\n  <ul class=\"reco-features-image\">\n<a href=\"https://xda.link/to/hM1CDG1r7\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"OnePlus Nord 2T\" class=\"wp-image-10741 alignleft\" src=\"https://www.xda-developers.com/files/2022/05/OnePlus-Nord-2T-gray-back-oqwefhwef.jpg\" width=\"213\" /></a>\n  </ul>\n     </div>\n<div class=\"col-md-8 col-sm-6\">\n<ul class=\"recodesc\">\nThe OnePlus Nord 2T is the latest mid-range offering from OnePlus, packing a lot of punch for the price.\n</ul>\n          <ul class=\"featuresinproductbox\">\t\t\t\t\n  <table class=\"vs-table-post proscons\">\t\t\t\n  <tbody>\t\t\t\t\t\n                                  <tr> \n            <td><ul class=\"tcb-styled-list features\"> \n<p class=\"featuresheader\">Features:</p> \n              </ul> \n              </td>     </tr> \n              <tr>\n              <td><ul class=\"featuresinboxcontainer\">\t\n          <li class=\"individualfeatures\"><span></span></li> \n          <li class=\"individualfeatures\"><span></span></li> \n          <li class=\"individualfeatures\"><span></span></li> \n                </ul></td> \n     </tr> \n  </tbody>\n</table> \n  </ul>\n  <ul class=\"proscons\">\n\t\t<table class=\"vs-table-post proscons\"> \n  <tbody> \n    <tr>\n            <td><ul class=\"tcb-styled-list featuresproscons\"> \n        <p class=\"prosheaderwfeatures\">Pros:</p>\n          <li class=\"individualpro\"><span></span></li>\n          <li class=\"individualpro\"><span></span></li>\n          <li class=\"individualpro\"><span></span></li></ul>\n        <ul class=\"tcb-styled-list featuresproscons\"> \n        <p class=\"consheaderwfeatures\">Cons:</p>\n          <li class=\"individualcon\"><span></span></li>\n          <li class=\"individualcon\"><span></span></li>\n          <li class=\"individualcon\"><span></span></li></ul></td>\n    </tr>\n  </tbody>\n</table>\n  </ul>\n  <ul class=\"product-cta\">\n<a class=\"button pn_sc\" href=\"https://xda.link/to/hM1CDG1r7\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><span class=\"xda_btn-content\">See at OnePlus</span><i class=\"icon fa fa-arrow-right\"></i></a>                                                                                                            </ul>\n</div>\n  </div>\n\t  </div>\n<div style=\"clear: both;\"></div>\n<p><img alt=\"OnePlus Nord 2T display\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-647699 size-large\" height=\"675\" src=\"https://www.xda-developers.com/files/2022/05/OnePlus-Nord-2T-1-Watermarked-1024x768.jpg\" width=\"900\" /></p>\n<h2>OnePlus Nord 2T: Specifications</h2>\n<div class=\"table_wrapper\"><table class=\"table_black\">\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Specification</th>\n<th>OnePlus Nord 2T</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Dimensions &amp;

The biggest change is the back camera placement, which looks a little bit odd in comparison. There are two large circles and two smaller cameras inside the bottom circle. These cameras are the same as what was available on the original OnePlus Nord 2, just moved around a bit.</p>\n<p>As for the display, you&#8217;d be hard pushed to find any differences between the two. It&#8217;s the same size, same brightness, same resolution, and same design. There is no visible difference between either of these two devices from the front. There&#8217;s still an alert slider on the side too. The display is consistent on my unit, both in its color uniformity and the 90Hz refresh rate.</p>\n<div class=\"quotecenter\">\n  <figure class=\"wp-block-pullquote quotestyle\">\n    <blockquote class=\"centerquotestyle\">\n      <p>As for the display, you'd be hard pushed to find any differences between the two</p>\n    </blockquote>\n  </figure>\n</div>\n\n\n<p><img alt=\"OnePlus Nord 2T with sunlight illuminating the OnePlus logo\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-648805\" height=\"675\" src=\"https://www.xda-developers.com/files/2022/05/OnePlus-Nord-2T-Back-1024x768.jpg\" width=\"900\" /></p>\n<p>All in all, it&#8217;s pretty much the same as what we found with the original Nord 2. I feel that it&#8217;s a bit of a downgrade in design, but functionally, it performs the exact same. There aren&#8217;t any real compromises that I&#8217;ve found, and you still even get the same gel case and pre-applied screen protector in the box.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;m not sure why OnePlus even changed up the design, though it may be partially to give the illusion of change giving nothing else is really different. The same mediocre speakers are present, and the fingerprint sensor is still under the display.</p>\n<h2>OnePlus Nord 2T: Same performance as before</h2>\n\n<a href=\"https://www.xda-developers.com/files/2022/05/OnePlus-Nord-2T-Geekbench-5.jpg\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"attachment-large size-large\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https://www.xda-developers.com/files/2022/05/OnePlus-Nord-2T-Geekbench-5-461x1024.jpg\" width=\"461\" /></a>\n<a href=\"https://www.xda-developers.com/files/2022/05/OnePlus-Nord-2T-CPU-Throttling-Test.jpg\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"attachment-large size-large\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https://www.xda-developers.com/files/2022/05/OnePlus-Nord-2T-CPU-Throttling-Test-461x1024.jpg\" width=\"461\" /></a>\n\n<p>The Dimensity 1300 features an octa-core SoC, with a \u201cprime\u201d Cortex-A78 core clocked up to 3GHz, while the other three performance cores are Cortex-A78 cores clocked up to 2.6GHz. The other four cores are Cortex-A55 clocked at up to 2.0GHz. The Dimensity 1200-AI in the Nord 2 was worked on <a href=\"https://www.xda-developers.com/oneplus-nord-2-oliver-zhang-interaction/\">as a collaboration between OnePlus and MediaTek</a>, whereas the Dimensity 1300 appears to be more of an off-the-shelf offering.</p>\n<p>As for the GPU, it comes with a nine-core ARM Mali-G77 GPU, supporting MediaTek\u2019s HyperEngine 3.0 gaming technologies. This includes 5G call and data concurrency support, as well as a multi-touch boost for increased touchscreen responsiveness. The complete combination also allows support for ray tracing in games and AR apps, and it also supports super hotspot power savings.</p>\n<p><div class=\"quoteright\">\n  <figure class=\"wp-block-pullquote pullrightstyle\">\n    <blockquote class=\"rightquotestyle\">\n      <p>We couldn't really find any discernible difference between the Dimensity 1200 and the Dimensity 1300</p>\n    </blockquote>\n  </figure>\n</div>\n\nYou would think that the bumped-up chipset would at least net <em>some</em> gains, right? Seemingly that isn&#8217;t the case though, which we kind of expected given that we couldn&#8217;t really <a href=\"https://www.xda-developers.com/mediatek-dimensity-1300-launched/\">find any discernible difference between the Dimensity 1200 and the Dimensity 1300</a>. The performance seems to be more or less the same, with both CPU Throttling Test and Geekbench 5 giving basically the same results, too.</p>\n<p>When it comes to performance, really, it&#8217;s basically the same phone as the OnePlus Nord 2. I asked OnePlus about the differences when it came to the chipset, and the differences that they were able to note were in the video and photography realm. Our same findings still apply here as with the OnePlus Nord 2, and I tested a few games and benchmarking applications to ensure that was definitely the case. Games such as <em>PUBG Mobile</em> and\u00a0<em>COD Mobile</em> run fine, and you can play games through the likes of Dolphin Emulator to varying degrees of success. It\u2019s not going to be a perfect emulation device, but for the price and performance it offers, it does a pretty great job as a portable emulation machine on a budget.</p>\n<p>Otherwise, you get up to 12GB of RAM and up to 256GB of UFS 3.1 storage. It&#8217;s a fast and smooth device, and if you&#8217;re not a gamer, then you likely won&#8217;t even notice that it&#8217;s not a flagship chipset in tow. There&#8217;s literally no reason to upgrade from the Nord 2 based solely on performance though, as it&#8217;s basically the same phone under the hood.</p>\n<h2>OxygenOS is still OxygenOS</h2>\n\n<a href=\"https://www.xda-developers.com/files/2022/05/OxygenOS-OnePlus-Nord-2T-1-Watermarked.jpg\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"attachment-large size-large\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https://www.xda-developers.com/files/2022/05/OxygenOS-OnePlus-Nord-2T-1-Watermarked-461x1024.jpg\" width=\"461\" /></a>\n<a href=\"https://www.xda-developers.com/files/2022/05/OxygenOS-OnePlus-Nord-2T-2-Watermarked.jpg\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"attachment-large size-large\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https://www.xda-developers.com/files/2022/05/OxygenOS-OnePlus-Nord-2T-2-Watermarked-461x1024.jpg\" width=\"461\" /></a>\n<a href=\"https://www.xda-developers.com/files/2022/05/OxygenOS-OnePlus-Nord-2T-3-Watermarked.jpg\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"attachment-large size-large\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https://www.xda-developers.com/files/2022/05/OxygenOS-OnePlus-Nord-2T-3-Watermarked-461x1024.jpg\" width=\"461\" /></a>\n<a href=\"https://www.xda-developers.com/files/2022/05/OxygenOS-OnePlus-Nord-2T-4-Watermarked.jpg\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"attachment-large size-large\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https://www.xda-developers.com/files/2022/05/OxygenOS-OnePlus-Nord-2T-4-Watermarked-461x1024.jpg\" width=\"461\" /></a>\n\n<p>The OnePlus Nord 2 was the first device from the company to launch with the merged result of ColorOS and OxygenOS, and it&#8217;s the same software here. It&#8217;s still clearly a skin on top of ColorOS, but that&#8217;s not inherently a bad thing. I love ColorOS on the <a href=\"https://www.xda-developers.com/oppo-find-x3-pro-review/\">OPPO Find X3 Pro</a> for example, and it has a lot of excellent features. The OnePlus 10 Pro, on the software front, was one of the most polished experiences I&#8217;ve had with a OnePlus phone in years.</p>\n<p>In terms of features, all of your favorite OxygenOS features are here on the OnePlus Nord 2T. It has the same user interface, the OnePlus Shelf (as part of the OnePlus Launcher), gaming mode, zen mode, and parallel apps to name a few. All of the features that people loved from OxygenOS were brought over in the integration, and so, the usual OnePlus-goodness should be present.</p>\n<p>What&#8217;s interesting is that OnePlus notes the Nord 2T will get two years of updates, but it launches with Android 12. In theory, its software support window will bring it an extra platform upgrade ahead of the OnePlus Nord 2, though, given both devices&#8217; similarities, I wouldn&#8217;t be too surprised if the company decided to treat them more or less the same when it came to updates.</p>\n<h2>OnePlus Nord 2T Cameras: Same cameras, too</h2>\n<p>The OnePlus Nord 2T is bizarrely the same phone in pretty much all aspects when it comes to the camera, too. OnePlus noted that there should be better nightscape results thanks to improved AI capabilities, but otherwise, the photos and videos are going to be the exact same. The photos and video taken below are from the OnePlus Nord 2, but they should be representative of what you can expect. The primary camera is capable of taking fantastic shots, though the others aren&#8217;t anywhere near as good.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/145036207@N04/albums/72157719727942990\" title=\"OnePlus Nord 2\"><img alt=\"OnePlus Nord 2\" height=\"768\" src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51374685332_bba0fc15ff_b.jpg\" width=\"1024\" /></a></p>\n<p>As noted at the time, the video performance of the OnePlus Nord 2 also greatly impressed me. It handled loud environments well and was a great aid in recording <em>On Melancholy Hill</em> by\u00a0<em>Gorillaz</em> at a concert in London.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>I wish OnePlus had bumped up some of the cameras here, particularly the auxiliary cameras. The wide-angle camera isn&#8217;t great, and the depth sensor could have been made into literally anything else that was more useful. The primary sensor is good, but that&#8217;s all there really is to write home about.</p>\n<h2>OnePlus Nord 2T Charging: 80W \u2248 65W, and battery is unchanged</h2>\n<p><div class=\"quoteleft\">\n  <figure class=\"wp-block-pullquote pullleftstyle\">\n    <blockquote class=\"leftquotestyle\">\n      <p>The 80W charger is pretty much worse than the 65W charger included alongside the Nord 2</p>\n    </blockquote>\n  </figure>\n</div>\n\nHere&#8217;s the other problem with the 80W charging &#8220;upgrade&#8221;. As we noted in our <a href=\"https://www.xda-developers.com/oneplus-10-pro-review/\">OnePlus 10 Pro review</a>, it&#8217;s\u00a0<em>barely</em> an upgrade, and the 80W charger is pretty much\u00a0<em>worse</em> than the 65W charger included alongside the Nord 2.</p>\n<p>OnePlus\u2019 65W charging brick is a great charger not just because of the high amperage it can provide to OnePlus phones, but it\u2019s actually one of the <a href=\"https://www.xda-developers.com/best-usb-pd-fast-charger/\">best USB Power Delivery compliant chargers</a> in general. It can charge a litany of devices at 45W without any problems, and I often used it to charge laptops, my Google Pixel, my Nintendo Switch, and other devices that accept USB Power Delivery.</p>\n<p>In other words, bumping up to 80W charging feels very much like a marketing gimmick. It doesn&#8217;t really\u00a0<em>achieve</em> much, and even if you gain a couple of minutes back of your time that you&#8217;re not wasting charging (if\u00a0<em>even</em>), you&#8217;re losing out on so much utility from the charging brick.</p>\n<p>On top of that, battery life is unchanged from my own usage. You&#8217;ll still get the same five to six hours of screen on time depending on how heavy your usage is, which is better than what most flagship devices are capable of putting up right now. The OnePlus Nord 2T can also charge up in roughly half an hour, which is extremely fast.</p>\n<h2>Why did OnePlus release the OnePlus Nord 2T?</h2>\n<p><img alt=\"OnePlus Nord 2T held in-hand\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-648803\" height=\"675\" src=\"https://www.xda-developers.com/files/2022/05/OnePlus-Nord-2T-In-Hand-1024x768.jpg\" width=\"900\" /></p>\n<p>Don&#8217;t get me wrong, the OnePlus Nord 2T is an excellent smartphone in its own right&#8230; but I don&#8217;t understand why it was released in the first place. Whenever the company releases a &#8220;T&#8221; upgrade, there&#8217;s generally\u00a0<em>something</em> substantial that has actually been changed, but that just isn&#8217;t the case here. Furthermore, the OnePlus Nord 2 was an already great phone that nobody was asking for an immediate successor to, so&#8230; why?</p>\n<p>My theory is that MediaTek&#8217;s release of the Dimensity 1300 meant that the Dimensity 1200 was actually\u00a0<em>replaced</em>. They&#8217;re essentially the same chipset from what we can gather, with a few minor improvements that to most users, won&#8217;t be noticeable. In that case, OnePlus decided to re-release the Nord 2 as it was a device that sold well according to reports, but couldn&#8217;t continue to produce more of it with the Dimensity 1200. Hence why we presume that the Nord 2T is being released with the Dimensity 1300, along with 80W charging tech just because the company has it. It would have been very confusing for consumers had OnePlus just launched this phone under the exact &#8220;Nord 2&#8221; branding &#8212; so the T moniker makes it easier to differentiate on these changed specs.</p>\n<p>Of course, that could be entirely conjecture and may not be the reasoning at all, but it&#8217;s the only thing I can think of that makes sense. It&#8217;s not a ploy to try and get people to upgrade from the Nord 2 early, because I can&#8217;t imagine why anyone actually would &#8212; most people don&#8217;t upgrade year-on-year either. Instead, it&#8217;s OnePlus possibly dealing with supply chain constraints and finding a way to make the most of a difficult situation.</p>\n<div class=\"quotecenter\">\n  <figure class=\"wp-block-pullquote quotestyle\">\n    <blockquote class=\"centerquotestyle\">\n      <p>Practically every review you've read of the OnePlus Nord 2 will apply to this one, too</p>\n    </blockquote>\n  </figure>\n</div>\n\n\n<p>So, should you buy the OnePlus Nord 2T? The answer is actually a good yes. If you need a new smartphone and don&#8217;t want to spend top dollar on one, the Nord 2T is an excellent choice as the Nord 2 was before it. It even costs the same as the last Nord too, starting at \u20ac399 for the base model. Basically, it&#8217;s a great device in its own right, but practically every review you&#8217;ve read of the OnePlus Nord 2 will apply to this one, too. The biggest difference is honestly the slightly different design, and you don&#8217;t need to own the phone or see it in real life to get an idea of whether you like it or not.</p>\n<p>You still get that flagship experience, and to most people, that&#8217;s more than enough. If you&#8217;re in the market for a new smartphone, you may as well pick this up over the Nord 2, even though it&#8217;s basically the same phone&#8230; unless you really want the older 65W USB PD-compliant charger instead. That would genuinely be a pretty difficult choice for me.</p>\n<div class=\"nanobox-topofpage\">\n<div class=\"xda_nanobox\">\n<ul class=\"nanobox-title\">\n  <a href=\"https://xda.link/to/hM1CDG1r7\"

This is great if you decide to expose this app using reverse proxy over the internet.</p><h3 id=\"final-notes-and-thoughts\">Final Notes and Thoughts</h3><p>Servas is nice, but to me it seems a tad unfinished. It&apos;s missing a few key features that I think would really make it shine. First, an import and export option so we can save our bookmarks to a file. Another great feature would be a browser bookmarklet so we can add links on the fly while we are browsing the web. Lastly, I want a DARK MODE! &#x1f606; We can still have these options and keep it basic right?</p><p>Simply put, if you love basic and simplicity, Servas is a great fit for you!
