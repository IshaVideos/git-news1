Ramsay Hunt syndrome mainly affects adults, but in rare cases, children may be affected.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Ramsay Hunt syndrome is also known as herpes zoster oticus or geniculate ganglion herpes zoster. The syndrome is a late complication of varicella-zoster virus (VZV) infection. Ramsay Hunt syndrome is a rare neurological condition, and results in inflammation of the geniculate ganglion of cranial nerve CVII.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Ramsay Hunt syndrome is named after American neurologist James Ramsay Hunt, who served as an army officer in World War I, and described three different syndromes during his lifetime. Of these, the most famous syndrome is the second, and is known as Ramsay Hunt syndrome.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Early stages of the Varicella-zoster virus infection cause fever and diffuse vesicular rash. Though the virus often remains dormant in the body after the initial infection, subsequent reactivation of the virus causes a &quot;zoster&quot; or &quot;herpes zoster&quot; phenomenon. The Ramsay Hunt syndrome consists of pain and a vesicular rash along the involved nerve's distribution, according to the US National Institutes of Health.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;The nerve involved determines the distribution and associated symptoms of the syndrome. In less than one per cent of zoster cases, the facial nerve is involved. When this happens, it results in Ramsay Hunt syndrome.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Symptoms Of Ramsay Hunt Syndrome&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Ramsay Hunt syndrome is characterised by ipsilateral (occurring on the same side of the body) facial paralysis, otalgia (ear pain), and vesicles in the auditory canal or on the auricle. People can experience a painful rash on the eardrum, ear canal, earlobe, tongue, and roof of the mouth on the side with the affected nerve.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Additional symptoms of Ramsay Hunt syndrome include a change in taste sensation, dry eye, tearing, hyperacusis, nasal obstruction, and dysarthria. Hyperacusis is a disorder in loudness perception, with patients suffering from this appearing overly sensitive to a range of sounds, finding many noises unbearable and painfully loud. Dysarthria is a motor speech disorder in which the muscles used to produce speech are damaged, paralysed or weakened.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;According to the NIH, hearing loss, tinnitus, and vertigo are observed in a person in which the vestibulocochlear nerve is affected. People can experience hearing loss on one side.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;A person with tinnitus experiences ringing or other noises in one or both the ears. Hoarseness in individuals with Ramsay Hunt syndrome may indicate involvement of the vagus nerve.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;After the onset of neurologic symptoms, vesicles may develop, but the first presenting symptom is usually pain. Though the vesicles typically appear on the auricle, they can be seen along the affected side of the face, scalp, palate, and tongue.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Some people may also experience a sensation of things spinning. Other symptoms include weakness on one side of the body that causes difficulty closing one eye, eating, making expressions, and making fine movements of the face, according to Mount Sinai Health System, an integrated health care system providing medical care to communities in New York, where it is based, and global communities.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How Can Ramsay Hunt Syndrome Be Diagnosed?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;A healthcare provider will usually diagnose Ramsay Hunt syndrome by looking for signs of weakness in the face and a blister-like rash, and through different tests.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;These tests may include blood tests for varicella-zoster virus, electromyography (EMG), Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) of the head, nerve conduction, and skin tests for varicella-zoster virus. Nerve conduction will help determine the amount of damage to the facial nerve.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How Can Ramsay Hunt Syndrome Be Treated?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Ramsay Hunt syndrome can be treated with strong anti-inflammatory drugs called steroids such as Prednisone. Other medications include antiviral medicines such as acyclovir or valacyclovir.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;If the pain continues even with steroids, strong painkillers are often given. While a person has weakness of the face, they may wear an eye patch to prevent injury to the cornea, and other damage to the eye if it does not close completely, according to Mount Sinai. A special eye lubricant may be used at night, and artificial tears could be used during the day to prevent the eye from drying out.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;The healthcare provider can advise other medicines if one has dizziness.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Prognosis Of Ramsay Hunt Syndrome&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;When there is not much damage to the nerve in a person, they are likely to get better completely within a few weeks. However, if the damage is more severe, they may not fully recover, even after several months.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;The chances of recovery are better if the treatment is started within three days after the symptoms begin.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What Are The Possible Complications Of Ramsay Hunt Syndrome?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;The possible complications of Ramsay Hunt syndrome include changes in the appearance of the face from loss of movement, change in taste, and damage to the eye, resulting in a loss of vision.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Also, certain nerves may grow back to the wrong structures, causing abnormal reactions to a movement. For instance, smiling causes the eye to close.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Other complications include persistent pain, and spasm of the face muscles or eyelids. Occasionally, the varicella-zoster virus may spread to other nerves, and even to the brain and spinal cord. This can result in confusion, drowsiness, headaches, limb weakness, and nerve pain.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;A hospital stay may be needed if these symptoms occur, and a spinal tap may help determine whether other areas of the nervous system have been infected.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How To Prevent Ramsay Hunt Syndrome?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;If a person loses movement in the face, or has a rash on the face and facial weakness, they must immediately reach out to a healthcare provider.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Though there is no known way to prevent Ramsay Hunt syndrome, treating it with medicine soon after symptoms develop can improve recovery.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;", "link": "https://news.abplive.com/explainers/ramsay-hunt-syndrome-facial-paralysis-justin-bieber-face-disorder-know-about-rare-neurological-condition-1537058", "published_js": "2022-06-13", "author": "Radifah Kabir"}, {"title": "Sri Lanka Electricity Chief Resigns After Withdrawing Remark Accusing PM Modi Of Pushing Adani Deal", "summary": "&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;New Delhi: &lt;/strong&gt;A Sri Lankan official has resigned after sparking a major controversy with his claim during a hearing before a parliamentary panel on Friday that Prime Minister Narendra Modi allegedly influenced President Gotabaya Rajapaksa to award a wind power project to the Indian multinational conglomerate Adani Group.

Know Its Connection With Crocodiles, Birds", "summary": "&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;An &quot;abnormal&quot; dinosaur egg in the form of an egg with another egg has been discovered in Madhya Pradesh, a state in western Central India. The egg, also called a pathologic egg, occurs in the form of an egg within another egg, a condition known as ovum-in-ovo. Pathologic eggs can also occur in the form of multi-shelled eggs showing additional pathological eggshell layer (s) along with the primary shell layer, and have been documented in the amniote eggs of birds, turtles, and dinosaurs. An amniote egg is an air-breathing egg characterised by a shell and extraembryonic membranes, which enclose the amniote embryo in a private pond during its development.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How Is The Discovery Special?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Though multi-shelled eggs and eggshells were previously recorded only in reptiles and ovum-in-ovo eggs in birds, it has now been shown that multi-shelled pathology can be found in birds also. However, no ovum-in-ovo egg had been reported in dinosaurs or other reptiles, until now.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;The new study, led by researchers at the University of Delhi, describes an ovum-in-ovo pathological egg from a titanosaurid dinosaur nest from the Upper Cretaceous Lameta Formation of western Central India. The paper was recently published in the journal&lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt; Scientific Reports.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt; The discovery marks the first report of egg pathology in dinosaurs.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What Are Titanosaurs?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Titanosaurs are a diverse group of sauropod dinosaurs which lived from the Late Jurassic Epoch (163.5 million to 145 million years ago) to the end of the Cretaceous Period (145 million to 66 million years ago). Sauropods were marked by large size, a long neck and tail, a four-legged stance, and a herbivorous diet. These reptiles were the largest of all dinosaurs and the largest land animals that ever lived.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Titanosaurs, like other sauropods, were herbivorous quadrupeds with long tails, long neck, and small heads, but differed from other sauropods in that the titanosaurs' bodies were stockier.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Oviduct Morphology Of Dinosaurs Was Similar To That Of Birds&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Birds have a specialised uterus while other amniotes have a generalised uterus. Amniotes are vertebrates which undergo foetal development within an amnion. Meanwhile, alligators and crocodiles retain a specialised uterus like birds, and also a reptilian mode of egg-laying. According to the study, the discovery of an ovum-in-ovo egg from a titanosaurid dinosaur nest suggests that the oviduct morphology of the dinosaurs was similar to that of birds. This indicates there is a possibility that sequential laying of eggs occurred in this group of sauropod dinosaurs.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;The researcher discovered 52 nests, and out of these, only one pathological egg was documented. According to the study, the abnormalities reflected in the eggshells include multiple eggshell units occurring in close contact with each other and one above the other, known as multi-shelled eggs, abnormally thick or thin eggshells, abnormally shaped shell units, extra shell units blocking pore canals, and surface defects.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ovum-In-Ovo Pathology Is Not Unique To Birds&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;The new finding underscores the fact that ovum-in-ovo pathology is not unique to birds and sauropods share a reproductive behaviour very similar to that of other archosaurs. This is a large group of vertebrates that includes reptiles such as dinosaurs and pterosaurs, and is represented by modern-day birds and crocodilians.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;There are two traits which collectively characterise dinosaurs, birds, and other archosaurs. One trait is that these animals have an oviparous mode of reproduction, in which organisms are produced by laying eggs. Another trait is that dinosaurs, birds, and other archosaurs lay cleidoic eggs, which are eggs enclosed in a relatively impervious shell that reduces free exchange with the environment. Cleidoic eggs are instrumental in the rise of amniotes.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sauropods Built Community Nests&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;According to the study, different egg macroscopic features and eggshell microstructures occur in different types of dinosaurs. For instance, spherical-shaped eggs were found in sauropods and elliptical-shaped eggs were found in theropods, which were carnivorous bipeds.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Bird-like behaviour has also been observed in the fossil record of dinosaurs in the form of nest constructions and evidence of parental care, especially in derived theropods. Meanwhile, hadrosaurs and sauropods spent their time in building community nests.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;The cross-sectional outline of the unusually double-layered in-situ egg found in the Upper Cretaceous Lameta Formation of Padlya, Dhar District, Madhya Pradesh shows physical organisation of the two shell layers similar to the ovum-in-ovo eggs previously reported in birds.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sauropods Had Reproductive Anatomy Similar To Those Of Archosaurs&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;In the paper, the researchers describe the newly found ovum-in-ovo pathological titanosaurid egg and discuss its preservation and relevance for understanding sauropod reproductive biology. The finding represents the first discovery of ovum-in-ovo pathology in dinosaurs. The researchers hypothesise that ovum-in-ovo pathology is not only unique to birds,and that sauropod dinosaurs had a reproductive anatomy similar to those of archosaurs such as crocodiles and birds. The reproductive anatomy of sauropod dinosaurs was not similar to that of non-archosaurian reptiles like turtles and lizards.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;The present discovery of an ovum-in-ovo pathological egg in a titanosaurid dinosaur nest is the first of its kind in dinosaurs and demonstrates its presence in reptiles as well, specifically in dinosaurs, the researchers conclude in the study. Moreover, the study underscores the fact that the reproductive biology of sauropods is more similar to that of archosaurs such as crocodiles and birds than to non-archosaurian reptiles. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;", "link": "https://news.abplive.com/science/abnormal-dinosaur-egg-discovered-in-madhya-pradesh-padlya-village-know-its-connection-with-crocodiles-birds-1537046", "published_js": "2022-06-13", "author": "Radifah Kabir"}, {"title": "Kuwait To Deport Expats Over 'Illegal Demonstration' Against Remarks On Prophet: Report", "summary": "&lt;p&gt;Dubai, Jun 13 (PTI) The Kuwaiti government has decided to arrest and deport an unspecified number of expats who participated in a protest against the controversial remarks by two former BJP functionaries against Prophet Mohammad, as the Gulf nation's laws do not allow such demonstrations, according to a media report.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Instructions have been issued to arrest expats from the Fahaheel area who organised a demonstration after Friday prayers in support of Prophet Muhammad, Arab News, an English-language daily newspaper published in Saudi Arabia, quoted sources as saying.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Kuwait said that the protestors will be deported to their respective countries as they violated the laws and regulations of the country which stipulates that sit-ins or demonstrations by expats are not to be organised in the Gulf nation, it said.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&quot;The detectives are in the process of arresting them and referring to the deportation center to be deported to their countries and will be banned from entering Kuwait again,&quot; reported Al Rai, a Kuwaiti newspaper.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The report did not mention the nationalities of those expatriates who took part in the demonstration.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;All expats in Kuwait must respect Kuwait laws and not take part in any type of demonstration.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The Kuwait government was one of the few countries who had summoned the Indian envoy over the remarks of the former BJP functionaries.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The Kuwait Foreign Ministry said that the Indian Ambassador to Kuwait Sibi George was summoned and handed over an official protest note by the Assistant Secretary of State for Asia Affairs expressing Kuwait's &quot;categorical rejection and condemnation&quot; of the statements issued by an official of the ruling party against the Prophet.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The ministry welcomed the statement issued by the ruling party in India, in which it announced the suspension of the leader.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The BJP suspended its national spokesperson Nupur Sharma and expelled its Delhi media head Naveen Kumar Jindal after their controversial remarks against the Prophet, as it sought to defuse a row over the issue.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Amid protests by Muslim groups over the remarks, the party also issued a statement aimed at assuaging the concerns of minorities and distancing itself from these members, asserting that it respects all religions and strongly denounces the insult of any religious personality.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Dozen Muslim countries condemned the controversial remarks.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;In New Delhi, the Ministry of External Affairs said the government has made it clear that the remarks do not reflect the views of the government.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&quot;We have made it pretty clear that tweets and comments do not reflect views of the government,&quot; MEA Spokesperson Arindam Bagchi had said at a recent media briefing.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&quot;This has been conveyed to our interlocutors as also the fact that action has been taken by the concerned quarters against those who made the comments and tweets.
