This is because her spine was restored to its original straight shape following a complex surgery at Sarvodaya Hospital, Faridabad.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;The surgery went on for 10 hours, and was conducted by a team of surgeons led by Dr Ashish Tomar, Senior Consultant, Orthopedics &amp;amp; Spine Surgery, Sarvodaya Hospital. The girl, 12, had been suffering from a rare but severe spinal deformity since she was seven years of age, as a result of which her back began to bend side-to-side from the normal spinal curve, a statement released by the hospital said. Her parents were the first to notice her condition, and decided to seek medical help. The girl's spinal curve kept growing and became very pronounced in the last two years.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Girl Was Suffering From Juvenile Idiopathic Scoliosis&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;In the statement, Dr Tomar said that the girl was diagnosed with Juvenile Idiopathic Scoliosis, a rare condition that can become life-threatening with lack of treatment. He explained that a patient suffering from this condition has an abnormal curvature of the spine, which causes the spinal column to bend left or right, in the shape of an S.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Curve Beyond 60 Degrees Becomes Progressive For Life&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Dr Tomar added that a curve of up to 10 degrees in a human spine is considered normal. However, a spinal curve beyond 60 degrees becomes progressive for life. This is because it will keep becoming more and more severe with time. He said the condition is present in about 0.5 per cent of the total population of children.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Girl Had A Spinal Curve Of 120 Degrees&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;When the girl visited the hospital, she already had a spinal curve of 120 degrees. The curve had progressed quickly by 40 degrees during the previous year, the statement said.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;The total volume of air that her lungs could hold had decreased, as she was suffering from a restrictive pulmonary disease. Dr Tomar said that the child's spine would have kept growing till she turned 18, and that the curve would have become more severe. He added that her lungs would have continued getting compressed, and that she would not have been able to breathe enough air. According to him, any delay in the treatment would have been life-threatening for her.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Girl Was Kept In Spinal Traction For A Week Before Surgery&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;There was also a risk of the girl getting paralysed from direct correction of such a massive spinal curve as hers. Therefore, she was kept in spinal traction for a week to loosen her tissues around the spine. As a result, the curvature of the spine was reduced to 80 degrees from 120 degrees. After this, the doctors operated on her.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How Was The Surgery Conducted?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Dr Tomar said the surgery was extremely difficult as fixing screws through the twisted, small bones of the spine was a very challenging task. He explained that the C-arm X-ray machine used routinely to guide the doctors during the surgery was of no use due to the massive deformity in her spine.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Dr Tomar said the pedicle bones that form the bridge between the vertebrae had become hard. Therefore, the hand manoeuvres were difficult. Despite all this, the surgery was a complete success, Dr Tomar said. The doctors managed to correct the spine deformity by as much as 75 per cent and the girl was able to walk on her own feet the very next day. He further said that the spinal curve was reduced to just 46 degrees from 120 degrees, curing the patient completely. Four days after her surgery, she was discharged.

It is endemic in parts of Africa, often in proximity to the tropical rainforests but not in South Africa.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Monkeypox is a viral disease that causes flu-like symptoms and skin lesions. While clinically less severe than smallpox, monkeypox is a viral zoonosis (a virus that spreads from animals to people) with symptoms that were once common among smallpox patients.

She further said the results reveal that although children with a positive Covid-19 diagnosis are more likely to experience long-lasting symptoms than children with no Covid-19 diagnosis, the pandemic has affected every aspect of all young people's lives. According to Berg, further research into the long-term consequences of the pandemic on all children will be important going forwards.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Study Analysed Children Up To Age Of 14 Who Tested Positive For Covid-19&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;While most previous studies of long Covid in young people have focussed on adolescents, the new study analysed infants, toddlers and other children up to the age of 14 who had tested positive for Covid-19 between January 2020 and July 2021.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;There Were Almost 11,000 Children With Positive Covid-19 Test&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Responses for almost 11,000 children with a positive Covid-19 test result were obtained.

The study found as many as 1,313 cases in the 12-14 age group, and 4,454 children in the control group who experienced long-lasting symptoms.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Non-Specific Symptoms Associated With Long Covid&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Children who are otherwise healthy often experience non-specific symptoms associated with long Covid. These include headache, mood swings, abdominal pain, and fatigue. These are all symptoms of common ailments that children experience which are unrelated to Covid-19.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Were Long-Lasting Symptoms A Representation Of Covid-19?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;The study found that children with a positive Covid-19 diagnosis were more likely to experience long-lasting symptoms than children who had never had a positive diagnosis. This suggests that these symptoms were a presentation of Covid-19.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;The finding is supported by approximately one-third of children with positive Covid-19 tests experiencing symptoms that were not present before the SARS-CoV-2 infection. According to the study, with increasing duration of symptoms, the proportion of children with those symptoms tended to decrease.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Children Diagnosed With Covid Reported Less Psychological Problems Than Kids In Control Group&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;The study found that children diagnosed with Covid-19 reported less psychological and social problems than children in the control group. The cases in older age groups often felt less scared, had less trouble sleeping, and felt less worried about what would happen to them.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;The increased pandemic awareness in older age groups could explain why they reported less psychological and social problems than children in the control group. The latter experienced fear of the unknown disease and more restricted everyday life due to protecting themselves from catching the virus.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Importance Of Knowledge Of Long-Term Symptom Burden In Covid Positive Children&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Berg said the opportunity to undertake such research is rapidly closing as the vast majority of children have now had a Covid-19 infection. For instance, 58 per cent of children in Denmark had lab-confirmed infection between December 2021 and February 2022. She added that the knowledge of long-term symptom burden in SARS-CoV-2 positive children is essential to guide clinical recognition, parental caregiving, and societal decisions about isolation, lockdown, non-pharmaceutical interventions, and vaccine strategies.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Berg explained that the findings of the study align with previous studies of long Covid in adolescents showing that, although the chances of children experiencing long Covid is low, especially compared to control groups, it must be recognised and treated seriously. She further said that more research will be beneficial to treat and better understand these symptoms and the long-term consequences of the pandemic on children going forward.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Limitations To The Study&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;The authors noted some limitations to the study. These include a long recall period between diagnosis and taking the survey. Recall period is the period of time patients are asked to consider in responding to a question. Also, the research was dependent on parent reported data which is less accurate for psychological symptoms, leading to selection bias as the mothers and guardians of children with more severe symptoms are often keener to respond. This leads to the results representing the most affected children.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Moreover, public testing for Covid-19 was only available from August 2020. This means that some children in the control group could have had undetected asymptomatic infections.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Covid Might Not Be Responsible For Non-Specific Symptoms&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Maren Rytter from the University of Copenhagen, Denmark, who was not involved in the study, wrote in a linked comment that the study found that symptoms of any kind were slightly more frequent in children who had been infected with SARS-CoV-2. However, the overall impact on children of having had Covid-19 is probably small, and likely much less than the impact of the indirect effects of the pandemic.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Rytter added that for most children with non-specific symptoms following Covid-19, the symptoms are more likely to be caused by something other than Covid-19. If these symptoms are related to Covid-19, they are likely to pass with time.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;", "link": "https://news.abplive.com/science/children-up-to-age-14-can-experience-long-covid-lasting-at-least-two-months-study-in-lancet-1538751", "published_js": "2022-06-23", "author": "Radifah Kabir"}, {"title": "Long COVID in infected children can last at least two months: Lancet study", "summary": "&lt;p&gt;London, Jun 23 (PTI): Children infected with the SARS-CoV-2 virus can experience symptoms of long COVID lasting at least two months, according to a study published in\u00a0The Lancet Child &amp;

&quot;The overall aim of our study was to determine the prevalence of long-lasting symptoms in children and infants, alongside quality of life, and absence from school or day care,&quot; said Professor Selina Kikkenborg Berg, from Copenhagen University Hospital, Denmark \t &quot;Our results reveal that, although children with a positive COVID-19 diagnosis are more likely to experience long-lasting symptoms than children with no previous COVID-19 diagnosis, the pandemic has affected every aspect of all young people's lives,&quot;

In the study, surveys were sent to the mother or guardian of children between 0-14 years who had tested positive for COVID-19 between January 2020 and July 2021.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In total, responses were received for almost 11,000 children with a positive COVID-19 test result who were matched by age and sex to over 33,000 children who had never tested positive for COVID-19.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The surveys asked participants about the 23 most common symptoms of long COVID in children and used the World Health Organization definition of long COVID as symptoms lasting more than two months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The most commonly reported symptoms among children 0-3 years old were mood swings, rashes, and stomach aches.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Among 4-11 years old the most commonly reported symptoms were mood swings, trouble remembering or concentrating, and rashes, and among 12-14 years old, fatigue, mood swings, and trouble remembering or concentrating.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The results of the study found children diagnosed with COVID-19 in all age groups to be more likely to experience at least one symptom for two months or longer than the control group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In the 0-3 years age group 40 per cent of children diagnosed with COVID-19 (478 of 1,194 children) experienced symptoms for longer than two months, compared to 27 per cent of controls (1,049 of 3,855 children).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; For the 4-11 years age group the ratio was 38 per cent of cases (1,912 of 5,023 children) compared to 34 per cent of controls (6,189 of 18,372 children), and for the 12-14 years age group, 46 per cent of cases (1,313 of 2,857 children) compared to 41 per cent of controls (4,454 of 10,789 children) experienced long-lasting symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

The campaign titled 'Eco Amritsar 450' will engage the civil society, educational institutions, diaspora community, religious and the governmental bodies, a media release said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In a statement, the EcoSikh said that in recent years, the city has suffered from degrading air quality and depleting groundwater resources. There is also a severe lack of systematic waste management and infrastructure to make it sustainable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; \u201cAmritsar has over 1,00,000 visitors and pilgrims coming to the city on a daily basis and the impact can be seen in the surrounding environment, from the strain on water and food resources to the extra energy used and the additional waste and litter created. It is critical that we take measures to conserve natural resources and plant forests to stop the environmental degradation,&quot; said Dr Rajwant Singh, global president of EcoSikh.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; EcoSikh India president Supreet Kaur said the green cover of the Amritsar city has shrunk significantly in recent years and many trees have been cut in recent times without being replaced. &quot;Planting forests will also help the city to fight the devastating impact of climate change.&quot; \t In the last 38 months, EcoSikh has planted over 400 forests as a part of its target to plant one million trees celebrating the 550th birth anniversary of Guru Nanak. It has also planted a few forests in Amritsar.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Trees planted via Miyawaki methodology in these forests are of native species and they attract biodiversity and are shown to improve the ecology of the area including lifting the water table, it said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In the past, from 2012- 2017, EcoSikh led a campaign Eco Amritsar to create awareness about the environmental challenges facing the city. It had lobbied SGPC to make the Darbar Sahib langar go organic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; EcoSikh was founded in 2009 in collaboration with the United Nations Development Program. Recently EcoSikh was represented at the Vatican summit called by the Pope and at Glasgow COP26. It has been invited by the White House, United Nations and is working with the World Economic Forum.

Key fundamentals under play are: current geo-political situation, innovation driven mindset of India\u2019s top leadership, and momentum in the western world for diversity, inclusiveness and equity in clinical trials,\u201d said Karun Rishi, president of USA-India Chamber of Commerce.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Being held virtually, like the previous two years, USAICC said the 16th annual BioPharma &amp; Healthcare Summit is being attended by several thousand from across the world. Indian government and industry leaders participating are Dr Vinod Paul, Member, NITI Aayog, Hari Bhartia, Kiran Mazumdar Shaw, Naresh Trehan, and Shiv Sarin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; There is a strong participation from the US government. Lawrence Tabak, Acting Director, National Institutes of Health (NIH) and Max Bronstein, Assistant Director for Health Innovation in the White House Office of Science &amp; Technology Policy (OSTP) are confirmed so are the past NIH Director Elias Zerhouni and the former US CDC Director Julie Gerberding.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Participation of Johnson &amp; Johnson\u2019s Executive Chairman Alex Gorsky, Biogen\u2019s Chairman Stelios Papadopoulos along with top venture capitalists, academic leaders from the Harvard, MIT and global Research and Development heads of Janssen, Takeda, Sanofi, Amgen, Bayer, UCB and several other leading companies demonstrates the interest of global biopharma companies to collaborate with India, USAICC said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Over the past few years, positive regulatory policies have been framed. Still, the global clinical trials being done in India are a very small percentage of overall global trials. This does not reflect India\u2019s true potential, Rishi said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; \u201cRobust clinical trials infrastructure and pragmatic regulatory policies are key for global clinical trials to come to India on a large scale. This will pave way for collaborations, investments, startups, employment generation of high paying jobs and GDP growth. Entire innovation ecosystem will be created in India,\u201d he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Rishi said developing and nurturing the next generation of innovative leaders in biopharma is fundamental to India becoming an innovation nation and source of innovation for accelerating discovery, development and manufacture novel therapeutics for India and for the rest of the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; \u201cThis is achievable. Political will is there. We need to work together for the common goal- patients. Global biopharma industry and the Indian government need to collaborate, communicate and remove trust deficit for the sake of patients,\u201d Rishi said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Andrew Plump, president of R&amp;D, Takeda Pharmaceuticals said this year\u2019s 16th Annual USAIC BioPharma &amp; Healthcare Summit will convene and engage leaders to share their insights on critical topics driving the biopharma ecosystem.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; \u201cThis year we are introducing a special panel focused on the clinical trial landscape in India, and we hope to identify opportunities where USAIC can collaborate with key stakeholders in India to promote clinical trial infrastructure, incentivise multinational biopharmaceutical companies to conduct trials, and ultimately enhance Indian patients\u2019 access to innovative medicines,\u201d he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Kiran Mazumdar Shaw, executive chairperson, Biocon Group and USAIC advisory Board member said that India\u2019s innovation ecosystem is developing rapidly on a platform of technology convergence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &quot;India\u2019s IT prowess has catalysed a Digital focus on biopharma innovation that is generating AI-powered diagnostics, Digital Health management and software for drug discovery,\u201d she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &quot;Handheld breast mammograms, AI powered CT-scans with instant readouts and rapid tests for viral and bacterial infections are some of the examples. Cell and gene therapies are also seeing rapid development with at least 3 start-ups with CAR-Ts in the clinic,\u201d she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; \u201cThe pandemic has revitalized the clinical research eco-system and the decade ahead will see India\u2019s biopharma space investing exponentially in discovery led innovation. USAIC\u2019s tireless efforts of driving India\u2019s innovation efforts over the last 16 years are finally being realized, \u201d said Shaw.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; \u201cInnovation in the biopharma industry continues to be fueled by scientific and technological advancements. The COVID-19 pandemic further expedited digitalization, transforming drug research &amp; development. Today several clinical trials are held virtually, with on-site visits limited to high-risk interventions and invasive monitoring,\u201d said Hari Bhartia, founder &amp; co-chairman, Jubilant Bhartia Group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Indian industry is also witnessing sweeping changes with massive investments by companies in scientific innovation like cell/gene therapies, integrated drug discovery models, mRNA-based vaccines etc, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\u201cThis is further amplified by digital innovations like AI-backed drug research and digital clinical trials management assets. Despite regulatory and legal challenges, India has the potential to become one of the largest clinical trial markets globally. Its strong medical infrastructure, IPR protection, patient availability, experienced talent and cost competitiveness will act as key differentiators,\u201d Bhartia said.
