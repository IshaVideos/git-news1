There has been a growing interest in the study of PAs involved in plant stresses, including drought, hypoxia, high temperature, low temperature, salinity, and metal toxicity. The main role of PAs in plant stress is to counteract the damage caused by reactive oxygen species (ROS) and to prevent free radical damage or oxidative stress while also modulating ion channels to protect the morphology and integrity of cell membranes, nucleic acids, and proteins. PAs interact with hormone pathways (ethylene, jasmonate, auxin, gibberellins, cytokinins, abscisic acid [ABA], salicylic acid, and brassinosteroids) and other signaling molecules (Ca2+, NO, H2O2, and gamma-aminobutyric acid) to help plants cope with adverse environments.", "link": "https://phys.org/news/2022-08-pa-aba-cbf-pathways-synergistically.html", "published_js": "2022-08-04", "author": "None"}, {"title": "How year-round crops could reduce farm pollution in the Mississippi River", "summary": "Don Wyse's field of winter barley used to be mostly empty in the spring.", "link": "https://phys.org/news/2022-08-year-round-crops-farm-pollution-mississippi.html", "published_js": "2022-08-04", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Plant-based 'beef' reduces carbon dioxide but threatens agriculture jobs", "summary": "Plant-based alternatives to beef have the potential to help reduce carbon dioxide emissions, but their growth in popularity could disrupt the agricultural workforce, threatening more than 1.5 million industry jobs, new economic models show.", "link": "https://phys.org/news/2022-08-plant-based-beef-carbon-dioxide-threatens.html", "published_js": "2022-08-04", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Regional growing environment impacts aroma of hops and the beers brewed with them, study finds", "summary": "Hops of the same variety grown in Oregon and Washington and beers brewed with those hops have different chemical properties and aroma profiles, a new Oregon State University study found.", "link": "https://phys.org/news/2022-08-regional-environment-impacts-aroma-beers.html", "published_js": "2022-08-04", "author": "None"}, {"title": "How can a cooperative-based organization of Indigenous fisheries foster resilience of declining stocks?", "summary": "A recent study in Environmental Policy and Governance explored how a cooperative organization of various stakeholders can help foster the development of a coastal fisheries-dependent community without increasing the pressure on the resource it harvests.", "link": "https://phys.org/news/2022-08-cooperative-based-indigenous-fisheries-foster-resilience.html", "published_js": "2022-08-04", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Genetically increasing wheat yield potential for food security", "summary": "The disruptions in global trading markets resulting from the war in Ukraine, among other causes, have focused public attention on the issue of securing a sufficient supply of high-quality foods for the global population.
