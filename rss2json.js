Later on, the word supermoon was used to denote only a Full Moon at perigee.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Nolle first used the term supermoon in a 1979 edition of Dell Horoscope, a now-defunct periodic American magazine covering modern astrology.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;According to an article published by Space.com, supermoons appear 14 per cent larger and 30 per cent brighter than Full Moons near the farthest distance from Earth, or apogee. The Full Moons occurring at apogee are referred to as micromoons or minimoons.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;A supermoon is around seven per cent larger and 15 per cent brighter than a standard Full Moon.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;The near coincidence of July's Full Moon with perigee will result in a dramatically large range of high and low ocean tides. Moreover, coastal storms at sea around this time are likely to aggravate flooding problems.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What Is The Moon Illusion?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;The phenomenon of the Moon appearing bigger during moonrise and moonset when it is still low on the horizon, is known as Moon illusion. Scientists believe that the Moon appears bigger during moonrise and moonset because of the human eyes playing tricks.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Some scientists believe that it is possible the brain compares the Moon with distant objects on the horizon, including buildings, which tricks the mind into thinking that the Moon is much larger.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ALSO READ | &lt;a title=&quot;James Webb Space Telescope's First Image: Deepest, Sharpest View Of The Universe Yet&quot; href=&quot;https://news.abplive.com/science/james-webb-space-telescope-first-image-deepest-sharpest-view-of-the-universe-yet-joe-biden-nasa-esa-galaxy-infrared-1542009&quot; target=&quot;&quot;&gt;James Webb Space Telescope's First Image: Deepest, Sharpest View Of The Universe Yet&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;More About Full Moons And New Moons&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Full Moons occur every 29 days, 12 hours, 44 minutes, and three seconds.

First-Of-Its-Kind Study Links Anger To Hunger", "summary": "&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;A new study has discovered how feeling hungry can make people &quot;hangry&quot;, a word used to describe someone who becomes bad-tempered irritable as a result of hunger. A team of researchers led by academics from Anglia Ruskin University (ARU) in the United Kingdom and the Karl Landsteiner University of Health Sciences in Austria found that emotions such as anger and irritability are strongly linked with hunger.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;The study, which is the first to investigate how hunger affects people's emotions on a day-to-day level, was recently published in the journal &lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;PLOS ONE.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Hangry is a portmanteau of hungry and angry, and is now used in everyday language. However, the phenomenon has not been widely explored outside of laboratory experiments.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Findings&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;According to the new study, hunger is associated with greater levels of anger and irritability, and lower levels of pleasure. As many as 64 adult participants from central Europe participated in the study. The researchers recorded their levels of hunger and several measures of emotional well-being over a 21-day period.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;The participants reported their feelings and levels of hunger on a smartphone app five times a day. This allowed data collection to take place in the participants' everyday environments, such as their workplace and at home.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;The study found that hunger is associated with stronger feelings of anger and irritability. However, the ratings of pleasure felt by the participants while hungry were low. The researchers took into account demographic factors such as age, sex, body mass index, dietary behaviour, and individual personality traits.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;New Study Is First To Examine Being &amp;lsquo;Hangry&amp;rsquo; Outside Of Lab&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;In a statement released by Anglia Ruskin University, Viren Swami, the lead author on the paper, said many people are aware that being hungry can influence one's emotions, but surprisingly little scientific research has focused on being 'hangry'.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;He stated that the new study is the first to examine being 'hangry' outside of a lab.

He explained that greater awareness of being 'hangry' could reduce the likelihood that hunger results in negative emotions and behaviours in individuals.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Stefan Stieger, a researcher at Karl Landsteiner University of Health Sciences, who carried out the field work, said this 'hangry' effect has not been analysed in detail.
