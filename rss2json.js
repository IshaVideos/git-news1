Following this, the presidential elections will be held on July 20.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Ranil Wickremesinghe is also expected to contest the presidential elections. His party is also likely to get the support of the ruling Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP), which has a majority of MPs in Parliament. Hence, the probability of others contesting against him remains low, Vinayan Sujeenan, a political observer in Sri Lanka, told ABP Live.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;If Ranil is elected as the President of Sri Lanka, he is likely to form an all-party government. In it, the big challenge will be the choice of the Prime Minister. To pacify the protesters, it is expected that Sajith Premadasa, who is the leader of the opposition, will be appointed as the Prime Minister.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Samagi Jana Balawegaya Party chief Sajith Premadasa enjoys strong support. The organiser of the party, Tissa Attanayake, said that a consensus of all parties was being formed regarding making Sajith Premadasa the PM.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;However, Sajith Premadasa, who lost the last presidential election against Gotabaya Rajapaksa, has been demanding some reforms in the Consitution. He is firm on making an amendment to curtail the powers of the President. If Ranil Wickramasinghe agrees to the demand, Sajith will accept the post of the PM.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Other Options&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Since the political views of Ranil and Sajith go against each other, Ranil may also consider making former President Maithripala Sirisena or Anura Kumara Dissanayake of Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna as the PM.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The SLPP of the Rajapaksas will favour a government by Ranil Wickremesinghe. Hence, they are also motivated to make Ranil the President and are skeptical on making Sajith the PM.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The party is also holding talks with Mahinda Rajapaksa and Gotabaya Rajapaksa on supporting Sajith or bringing Sirisena into the contest. Even though Anura Kumara Dissanayake's name is also being discussed, there is an opinion that he may not be the first choice due to the limited support of MPs.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Vinayan Sujeenan said there are high possibilities for Ranil to become the President and Sajith to become the PM of Sri Lanka.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;In the current scenario, it will be a big challenge whoever takes the PM's office since the government is going to be formed with the support of all the parties, said Vinayan Sujeenan.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;After the presidential elections, an all-party Cabinet would be sworn-in and they would rule for the next two years. However, whichever government is formed, it would be very tough to find an immediate solution to the economic crisis in Sri Lanka.

As Vice Chair of the India Caucus, I have been working to strengthen the partnership between our countries and ensure that India can defend itself along the Indian Chinese border,&quot; said Khanna, the US representative from California's 17th congressional district.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&quot;This amendment is of the utmost importance, and I am proud to see it pass the House on a bipartisan basis,&quot; he said.&amp;nbsp; The law was brought in 2017 and provides for punitive actions by the US government against any country engaged in transactions with the Russian defence and intelligence sectors.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;In October 2018, India signed a USD 5 billion deal with Russia to buy five units of the S-400 air defence missile systems, despite a warning from the then-Trump administration that going ahead with the contract may invite US sanctions. The S-400 is known as Russia's most advanced long-range surface-to-air missile defence system.The US has already imposed sanctions on Turkey under the CAATSA for the purchase of a batch of S-400 missile defence systems from Russia.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Following the US sanctions on Turkey over the procurement of S-400 missile systems, there were apprehensions that Washington may impose similar punitive measures on India.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The US has not yet made any decision on potential sanctions or waivers to India under CATSAA law for its purchase of the S-400 missile defence system from Russia, Secretary of State Antony Blinken said in April.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The Ministry of External Affairs has said that India was pursuing an independent foreign policy and its defence acquisitions are guided by its national security interests.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;In his remarks on the House floor, Khanna said there is no relationship of greater significance to US strategic interests than the US-India partnership.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&quot;My bipartisan NDAA amendment marks the most significant piece of legislation for US-India relations out of Congress since the US-India nuclear deal,&quot; Khanna, a Democrat, said.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The legislation says that the United States-India Initiative on Critical and Emerging Technologies (ICET) is a welcome and essential step to developing closer partnerships between governments, academia, and industry in the two countries to address the latest advances in artificial intelligence, quantum computing, biotechnology, aerospace, and semiconductor manufacturing.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Such collaborations between engineers and computer scientists are vital to help ensure that the United States and India, as well as other democracies around the world, foster innovation and facilitate technological advances which continue to far outpace Russian and Chinese technology, it said.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;", "link": "https://news.abplive.com/news/world/us-house-votes-for-caatsa-sanctions-waiver-to-india-over-s-400-missile-deal-with-russia-1542625", "published_js": "2022-07-15", "author": "PTI"}]}, "swarajyamag.com": {"feed": {"title": "swarajyamag.com"}, "entries": [{"title": "\u2018With You, Without You, Or In Spite Of You\u2019: Why Modi Government Was Right In Ignoring Perennial Detractors At A Time Of Global Turmoil -
