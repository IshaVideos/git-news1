Chauvin also pleaded guilty to willfully depriving a then-14-year-old child of his constitutional right to be free from the use of unreasonable force by a police officer, resulting in the child's bodily injury.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&quot;In no uncertain terms, George Floyd should be alive today,&quot; said Assistant Attorney General Kristen Clarke for the Justice Department's Civil Rights Division in its December 2021 judgement, reported ANI.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&quot;Defendant Chauvin's use of excessive force and his failure to provide medical care resulted in Floyd's senseless murder. Chauvin's unlawful actions in a separate incident also resulted in injury to a 14-year-old child. This sentence should send a strong message that the Justice Department stands ready to prosecute law enforcement officers who use deadly force without basis. While no amount of prison time can reverse the tragic consequences of Derek Chauvin's violent actions, we hope that this sentence provides some small measure of justice for the families and communities impacted,&quot; Clarke added.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;After more than a month-long trial, the federal jury On Feb 24, 2022 convicted three other officers - former Minneapolis Police Officers Tou Thao, J. Alexander Kueng, and Thomas Kiernan Lane - of violating civil rights statute in the George Floyd murder.

Then, the process began with 10 candidates, and took six ballots.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;In 2016, Theresa May became the leader less than three weeks after David Cameron resigned.

Recently during the UK-India Awards in Windsor, Sunak spoke of the sacrifices made by his National Health Service (NHS) general practitioner (GP) father Yashvir and pharmacist mother Usha.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;During the Covid pandemic, Sunak was widely praised for the economic rescue package he rolled out along a costly jobs retention programme that averted mass unemployment in the country. However, he faced criticism from some fractions for not giving enough cost-of-living support to households.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4. &lt;/strong&gt;The former minister stirred a controversy after Akshata Murthy, his wife and Narayana Murthy&amp;rsquo;s daughter, allegedly avoided payment of taxes on her overseas income. Sunak also faced scrutiny for allegedly not giving up his US green card while serving in the British government.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;Sunak was born to Indian parents who moved to Britain from East Africa.
