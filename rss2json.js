Omega-3 fatty acids are present in different foods, and can also be consumed in the form of supplements or nutraceuticals.

People can also consume combined DHA and EPA in the form of supplements.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Previous studies had suggested that the consumption of Omega-3 fatty acids may lower blood pressure. However, the optimal dosage to lower blood pressure had not been clear. According to the US National Institutes of Health, a daily intake of 1.1 to 1.6 grams of Omega-3 fatty acids is adequate for healthy people. The amount consumed depends on age and sex.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;In a statement released by the American Heart Association, study author Xinzhi Li said that according to the research, the average adult may have a modest blood pressure reduction from consuming about three grams a day of these fatty acids.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;The results of 71 clinical trials from around the world, published from 1987 to 2000, were analysed as part of the research. The clinical trials had examined the relationship between blood pressure and the Omega-3 fatty acids DHA and EPA, either individually or combined, in people aged 18 and older with or without high blood pressure or cholesterol disorders. The research analysed a total of about 5,000 participants, ranging in age from 22 to 86 years, who took dietary and/or prescription supplement sources of fatty acids for an average of 10 weeks.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Adults Who Consumed 2-3 Grams Of Daily Combined DHA &amp;amp; EPA Had Reduced BP&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;According to the study, adults who consumed between two and three grams of daily combined DHA and EPA omega-3 fatty acids in the form of food or supplements had reduced systolic and diastolic blood pressure by an average two mm Hg, compared to adults who did not consume EPA and DHA.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Important Findings Of The Study&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Consumption of more than three grams of Omega-3 fatty acids may have added blood pressure-lowering benefits for adults with high blood pressure or high lipids.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;For people with hypertension who consumed three grams a day or Omega-3 fatty acids, systolic blood pressure decreased an average of 4.5 mm Hg. For people without hypertension, systolic pressure decreased about two mm Hg on average.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;The systolic blood pressure declined an average of nearly four mm Hg for people with hypertension who consumed five grams a day of Omega-3 fatty acids. For people without hypertension, consumption of five grams a day of Omega-3 fatty acids caused the systolic blood pressure to decline less than one mm Hg on average.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;People with high blood lipids and those older than 45 years of age showed similar differences.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Consumption of about four to five ounces of Atlantic salmon provides three grams of Omega-3 fatty acids.

This suggests supplements may be an alternative for those who cannot eat fatty fish such as salmon regularly. For people who do not consume fish or other animal products, algae supplements with EPA and DHA fatty acids are also an option, Li suggested.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;In June 2019, the US Food and Drug Administration announced that it did not object to the use of certain health claims that consuming EPA and DHA Omega-3 fatty acids in good or dietary supplements may reduce the risk of hypertension and coronary heart disease.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Li explained that the study supports the FDA guidance that EPA and DHA Omega-3 fatty acids may reduce the risk of coronary heart disease by lowering high blood pressure, especially among people already diagnosed with hypertension.

This provided the opportunity to determine if the fantastic giant tortoise species lives on. A paper confirming the continued existence of the species was recently published in the journal &lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Communications Biology.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Genome Of Fernanda Compared With Genomes Of 13 Species Of Gal&amp;aacute;pagos Giant Tortoises&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Princeton University's Stephen Gaughran, a co-first author on the paper, sequenced the genomes of both the living individual and the museum specimen of the species, and compared them to the other 13 species of Gal&amp;aacute;pagos giant tortoises. He shows that the two known Fernandina tortoises are members of the same species, which is genetically distinct from all others.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;In a statement released by Princeton University, Peter Grant, a professor on evolutionary biology at Princeton who has spent more than 40 years studying evolution in the Gal&amp;aacute;pagos islands, said for many years, it was thought that the original specimen collected in 1906 had been transplanted to the island, as it was the only one of its kind, but it now seems to be one of a very few that were alive a century ago.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What Made Ecologists Doubt Fernanda Is Not A Native Phantasticus Tortoise?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Many ecologists doubted Fernanda to be a native phantasticus tortoise when she was discovered. Fernanda lacks the striking saddleback flaring of the male historical specimen, according to the study. Scientists speculated that Fernanda's obviously stunted growth may have distorted her features.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;According to the statement, tortoises cannot swim from one island to another, but they do float, and can be carried from one Gal&amp;aacute;pagos island to another during hurricanes or other major storms, and there are also historical records of seafarers moving the tortoises between islands.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Gaughran said that like many people, his initial suspicion was that this was not a native tortoise of Fernandina Island.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Gaughran sequenced Fernanda's complete genome and compared it to the genome he was able to recover from the specimen collected in 1906, in order to determine Fernanda's species definitively. The scientist also compared the two genomes to samples from the other 13 species of Gal&amp;aacute;pagos tortoises, which include three individuals each of 12 living species, and one individual of the extinct &lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Chelonoidis abingdonii.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fernanda Was Very Similar To One Found More Than 100 Years Ago&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Gaughran said the researchers involved in the study saw that Fernanda was very similar to the one that they found on that island more than 100 years ago, and both of those were very different from all of the other islands' tortoises.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Adalgisa Caccone from Yale University, a senior author on the paper, said the finding of one alive specimen gives hope and also opens up new questions, as many mysteries still remain. These questions include whether there are more tortoises on Fernandina that can be brought back into captivity to start a breeding program, how tortoises colonised Fernandina, and what their evolutionary relationship to other giant Gal&amp;aacute;pagos tortoises is. Caccone said this also shows the importance of using museum collections to understand the past.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Though museum specimens are a challenge to analyse genetically, Gaughran has been focused on it for years, developing a tool that is flexible enough to work on many species, and compare DNA from ancient specimens to modern specimens. He said the software does not care if it is a seal or tortoise or human or Neanderthal, and that genetics is genetics, for the most part. It is in the kind of interpretation where it matters what kind of the creature the DNA comes from, he explained.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Andrea Graham, an ecologist at Princeton, said Stephen Gaughran solves conservation mysteries, in species ranging from tortoises to pinnipeds, with the deft and careful application of genetic and bioinformatic tools. Bridgett vonHoldt, another ecologist at Princeton, said Stephen has such a curiosity for discovering the messages and codes tucked away in ancient remains. He added that Stephen has been collecting specimens from several hundred years old to a few thousand, and these really hold the keys for understanding the history of when and how genomes changed over time. Bridgett vonHoldt asserted that it is not surprising to him that Stephen also led the effort to unravel the mystery of Fernanda, the fantastic ghost tortoise that has been rediscovered through molecular research.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Compelling Evidence On Existence Of Giant Tortoises On Fernandina Island Since 1906&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Since 1906, there has been scant but compelling evidence which hinted that giant tortoises might still live on Fernandina Island, an active volcano on the western edge of the Gal&amp;aacute;pagos Archipelago that is reputed to be the largest pristine island on Earth, the study said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Explorer Rollo Beck Collected Single Specimen Of C. phantasticus In 1906&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;According to the statement, a single specimen of Chelonoidis phantasticus, &quot;the fantastic giant tortoise&quot;, was collected by explorer Rollo Beck during a 1906 expedition. The study said that the &quot;fantastic&quot; nature refers to the extraordinary shape of the males' shells, which have extreme flaring along the outer edge and conspicuous saddlebacking at the front, a feature unique to Gal&amp;aacute;pagos tortoises. The phantasticus tortoise shows saddlebacking more prominently than the other species.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Other Observations Of Tortoises On Fernandina Island&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Ever since the Fernandina tortoise was discovered in 1906, its survival has remained an open question for biologists. As many as 18 scats attributable to tortoises were reported on the western slopes of Fernandina Island, in 1964. During the early 2000s, scats and a possible visual observation from an aircraft were reported. In 2014, another tortoise scat was seen.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Due to the extensive lava fields blocking access to the island's interior, the island has remained largely unexplored.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fernandina Island Is Highest Of Gal&amp;aacute;pagos Islands&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Grant said Fernandina is the highest of the Gal&amp;aacute;pagos islands, geologically young, and is mainly a huge pile of jagged blocks of brown lava. He added that at lower elevations, the vegetation occurs in island-like clumps in a sea of recently congealed lava, and that Fernanda was found in one of these. There is evidence that a few relatives may exist in others, according to Grant.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Fernanda is estimated to be well over 50 years old. However, she is small, possibly because of the limited vegetation, the study said. During other recent expeditions on the island, the researchers found recent tracks and scat of at least two or three other tortoises.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Storms Carried One Or More Giant Tortoises&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;About two to three million years ago, one or more giant tortoises were carried from the South American mainland westwards due to storms. The tortoises are only with others on their own islands because they do not swim. This resulted in rapid evolution, following the pattern of the better-known Gal&amp;aacute;pagos finches. At present, there are 14 different species of giant Gal&amp;aacute;pagos tortoises all descended from a single ancestor, according to Princeton University.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Though some scientists debate whether these tortoises should be considered species or subspecies, the Princeton-Yale team concluded that they are different enough, with thousands of distinctive genetic markers, to be considered separate species.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How Gal&amp;aacute;pagos Tortoises Diversified&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;As the Gal&amp;aacute;pagos tortoises diversified, they developed a continuum of shell shapes, with the easternmost islands' animals showing rounder, domed shells, and the westernmost island &amp;mdash; Fernandina &amp;mdash; home to tortoises with the most dramatic saddlebacking.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;While the domed tortoises live in more humid, higher elevation ecosystems, their saddlebacked cousins inhabit drier, lower elevation environments. All the 14 species of giant Gal&amp;aacute;pagos tortoises are listed on the International Union for Conservation of Nature's (IUCN) Red List as either vulnerable, endangered, critically endangered or extinct.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How The Tortoise Populations Decimated&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;European seafarers hunted the tortoise populations for food, resulting in the decimation of their populations. The tortoises were used as food because the seafarers realised that the animals could be alive on ships with minimal effort, and could survive with little food or water. Gaughran said they were a great source of fresh meat for the sailors, but it meant that many of the species were severely overhunted.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Where Are Nearest Relatives Of Fernandina Tortoise Found?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Grant added that the genetic work provides intriguing hints of a mixing of genes with members of another population, and that it would be fascinating if confirmed by future detective work on the genome. The researchers also found that the nearest relatives are not on the nearest very large island, Isabela, but on another island, Espa&amp;ntilde;ola, which is far away on the other side of Isabela. The question of how the ancestors reached Fernandina is left hanging, Grant said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;According to Princeton University, Fernanda is now at the Gal&amp;aacute;pagos National Park Tortoise Center, a rescue and breeding facility, where experts are seeing what they can do to keep her species alive.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Grant said the discovery informs researchers about rare species that may persist in isolated places for a long time, and this information is important for conservation. He added that it spurs biologists to search harder for the last few individuals of a population to bring them back from the brink of extinction.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;", "link": "https://news.abplive.com/science/fernanda-believed-extinct-for-more-than-a-century-giant-tortoise-rediscovered-in-galapagos-1536930", "published_js": "2022-06-12", "author": "Radifah Kabir"}, {"title": "Afghanistan: Explosion In Kunar Kills One Taliban Member And Wounds Six Others", "summary": "&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;New Delhi: &lt;/strong&gt;An explosion on Sunday in Kunar, Afghanistan, killed a Taliban member and injured six others, including a civilian.
