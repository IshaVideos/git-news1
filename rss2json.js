Ailurarctos were an ancient relative of the giant panda that lived in China six to eight million years ago, and are now extinct.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why Has The &amp;ldquo;Thumb&amp;rdquo; Not Enlarged Further?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;According to the study, the &quot;thumb&quot; has not enlarged further because it must be balanced with the constraints of weight bearing while walking in a plantigrade posture. Plantigrade foot posture is one in which the heel contributes to support of body weight during walking, running and standing. In other words, plantigrade posture is one in which the surface of the whole foot touches the ground during locomotion.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The &amp;ldquo;Thumb&amp;rdquo; Performs A Dual Function&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;The authors noted in the study that this morphological adaptation in panda evolution reflects a dual function of the radial sesamoid for both bamboo manipulation and weight distribution. The constraints of weight bearing could be the main reason why the panda's false thumb never evolved into a full digit. The crude &quot;thumb&quot; suggests that the origin of the panda's dedicated bamboo diet dates back to as early as six to seven million years ago.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So Far, There Was Lack Of Evidence About How The Extra Digit Evolved&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Though the panda's false thumb had been known for about a century, the lack of fossil evidence had left questions unanswered about how and when the extra digit, which is not seen in any other bear, evolved.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;The researchers found the enlarged radial sesamoid along with a broken canine and a partial humerus from the late Miocene site in the Zhaotong Basin, Yunnan Province. The false thumb found in China was longer than that found in modern pandas, but without a sharp bend inward on the distal end to form a hook.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Ursid is a plantigrade carnivore of the family Ursidae which comprises the spectacled bear, the black, brown and sun bears, and various extinct species that gave rise to the giant panda of the family Ailuropodidae.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Eating Habits Of Pandas&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;According to the study, pandas traded the high-protein, omnivorous diet of their ursid ancestors for bamboo, a woody grass of high fibre and low nutrition. However, bamboo had a year-round availability in South China and Southeast Asia millions of years ago. Depending on the season, pandas eat prodigious quantities of bamboo, up to 45 kilograms a day.

The device consists of around 100 tonnes of builder's sand. According to the article, the rough and ready grains may represent a simple and cost-effective way of storing power for the moment when it is needed the most.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;There has been an increase in the investment in new renewable energy production due to climate change and rapidly rising prices of fossil fuels. Though solar panels and wind turbines can quickly be added to national grids, the extra sources present huge challenges.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Drawbacks Of Large Scale Batteries&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;When more renewables are added to the electricity grid, other energy sources must be boosted to balance the network. Otherwise, too much or too little power can cause the electricity grid to collapse.

Moreover, they can only cope with a limited amount of excess power.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Now, a team of Finnish engineers from the town of Kankaanp&amp;auml;&amp;auml; have completed the first commercial installation of a battery made from sand, the article stated.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How The Sand Battery Works&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;The engineers believe the battery can solve the storage problem in a low-cost, low impact way.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Quoting Markku Yl&amp;ouml;nen, one of the two founders of Polar Night Energy who have developed the product, the article said whenever there is a high surge of available green electricity, one would want to be able to get it into the storage really quickly.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;The Vatajankoski power plant runs the district heating system for the area. The sand battery has been installed in this plant.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Resistive heating causes the temperature of the sand to increase by 500 degrees Celsius. Resistive heating, also known as Joule heating or Ohmic heating, is the process by which the passage of an electric current through a conductor produces heat. In other words, whenever an electric current flows through a material that has some resistance, it creates heat.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;The hot air generated is circulated in the sand by means of a heat exchanger. Since sand is a very effective medium for storing heat and loses little over time, the developers believe the sand battery could keep sand at 500 degrees Celsius for several months.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Therefore, when energy prices increase, the battery can discharge the hot air. This air will warm the water for the district heating system, which is pumped around homes, offices and the local swimming pool.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Sand Battery May Benefit Food And Drink, Textile Industries&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Tampere, Finland was the place where the idea for the sand battery was first developed. According to the article, Elina Sepp&amp;auml;nen, an energy and climate specialist for Tampere, said if there are power stations that are just working for a few hours in the wintertime, when it is the coldest, it is going to be extremely expensive.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;She suggested that if there is a solution that provides flexibility for the use, and storage of heat, that would help a lot in terms of expense.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Certain challenges are associated with the sand battery, one of them being whether the technology can be scaled up to really make a difference. Also, an important question is whether the developers will be able to use the sand battery to generate electricity as well as heat.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;When the sand is used to return power to the electricity grid, the electricity falls dramatically, the article said. The fact that the sand battery can be used for storing green energy as heat should for a longer time not be undermined. This will benefit the food and drink, textiles and pharmaceutical industries where most of the heat used to conduct the processes is generated by burning fossil fuels. By avoiding the use of fossil fuels, climate change can be tackled.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;The US National Renewable Energy Laboratory is a research group actively looking at sand as a viable form of battery for green power.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Pekka Passi, the managing director of the Vatajankoski power plant, said the technology is really simple, but the researchers linked the idea of trying something new, &quot;to be the first in the world to do something like this&quot;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;", "link": "https://news.abplive.com/science/sand-battery-world-first-fully-working-sand-battery-know-how-this-green-energy-source-works-1541062", "published_js": "2022-07-06", "author": "ABP News Bureau"}, {"title": "India Asks Sri Lanka To Pay For Fuel In Advance As Credit Lines Exhausted: Report", "summary": "&lt;p&gt;As credit lines to Sri Lanka were exhausted, India is seeking payment in advance for supply of fuel to the island nation, citing sources, Bloomberg reported on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Quoting sources, the news agency reported that the Indian government officials said that New Delhi stopped supplying gasoline and diesel on credit after Sri Lanka ran out of dollars to purchase fuels amid its worst economic crisis.

The drawback associated with these tools is that they miss out on the complex social environment of cities. Moreover, they do not consider the relationship between crime and the effects of police enforcement.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How The New Model Is Unique&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;James Evans, a co-author on the paper, said spatial models ignore the natural topology of the city.

The model developed by the researchers at the University of Chicago enables discovery of those connections, he said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;New Model Divides The City Into Spatial Areas 1,000 Feet Across&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;According to the study, the new model isolates crime by looking at the time and spatial coordinates of discrete events and detecting patterns to predict future events. Instead of relying on traditional neighbourhood or political boundaries, which are subject to bias, the new model divides the city into spatial tiles roughly 1,000 feet across and predicts from within these areas. The model not only performed well with the data from Chicago, but also data from seven other cities in the United States, namely Atlanta, Austin, Detroit, Los Angeles, Philadelphia, Portland, and San Francisco.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Evans said the researchers demonstrated the importance of discovering city-specific patterns for the prediction of reported crime. This generates a fresh view on neighbourhoods in the city, allows researchers to ask novel questions, and lets them evaluate police action in new ways, he explained.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Tool Should Not Be Used To Direct Law Enforcement&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;According to the authors, the tool's accuracy does not mean that it should be used to direct law enforcement, with police departments using it to swarm neighbourhoods proactively to prevent crime. The tool should instead be used as a toolbox of urban policies and policing strategies to address crime.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Chattopadhyay said they created a digital twin of urban environments. If one feeds it with data from what happened in the past, it will tell them what is going to happen in the future.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;However, the model is not devoid of limitations. One can use the simulation tool to see what happens if crime goes up in one area of the city, or there is increased enforcement in another area. If one applies all these different variables, they can see how the system evolves in response.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;", "link": "https://news.abplive.com/science/ai-algorithm-predict-future-crimes-one-week-in-advance-with-90-percent-accuracy-know-more-details-1540687", "published_js": "2022-07-06", "author": "Radifah Kabir"}, {"title": "ESA's XMM-Newton Captures Manatee Nebula, Cosmic Creature Accelerating Particles From Head | SEE PIC", "summary": "&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;European Space Agency's (ESA) X-ray space observatory XMM-Newton has X-rayed a beautiful cosmic creature known as the Manatee Nebula, and has found the location of unusual particle acceleration in its 'head'.

A black hole remains at the core of the Manatee Nebula, which is unusual for a supernova remnant. The black hole feeds on gas it collects from a very close companion star. The nebula's gas disc and powerful magnetic field lines act like an enormous railroad system.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;The Manatee Nebula catches charged particles and channels them outward as powerful jets travelling at nearly the speed of light, according to the National Radio Astronomy Observatory. This system shines brightly in both radio waves and X-rays and is collectively known as the SS 433 microquasar, which emits powerful jets of particles. These particles travel at speeds close to a quarter the speed of light that punch through the gassy shells, creating the double-lobed shape.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What Do The Colours In The Manatee Nebula Image Captured By ESA Represent?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;According to the ESA, SS 433 is identified by the red dot in the middle of the image.
