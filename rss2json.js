The strains containing genes having resistance to classical front-line antibiotics ampicillin, chloramphenicol, and trimethoprim or sulfamethoxazole were classified as multidrug-resistant (MDR). Macrolides and quinolones are among the most critically important antibiotics for human health, and hence, the authors traced the presence of genes conferring resistance to these antibiotics.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Where Have Resistant S. Typhi Strains Spread?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Resistant S.

Around 97 per cent of these strains originated in South Asia. By the early 2000s, quinolone-resistant strains accounted for more than 85 per cent of S. Typhi in Bangladesh. The strains increased to more than 95 per cent in India, Pakistan, and Nepal by 2010.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pattern Of Emergence Of Mutations Causing Resistance To Azithromycin&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;In the past 20 years, mutations causing resistance to Azithromycin have emerged at least seven times in the past 20 years.

Typhi have emerged and spread in recent years is a real cause for concern, and highlights the need to urgently expand prevention measures in countries at greatest risk. He added that at the same time, the fact resistant strains of S. Typhi have spread internationally so many times also underscores the need to view typhoid control, and antibiotic resistance more generally, as a global rather than local problem.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Limitations To The Study&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;The authors stated some limitations to the study, including the fact that there remains of underrepresentation of S. Typhi sequences from several regions, particularly many countries in sub-Saharan Africa and Oceania, where typhoid is endemic.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;In order to improve understanding of timing and patterns of spread, more sequences from these regions are needed. Most isolates come from a small number of surveillance sites and may not be representative of the distribution of circulating strains, even in countries with better sampling.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;According to the authors, estimates of resistance-causing mutations and international spread are likely underestimated because S. Typhi genomes only cover a fraction of all typhoid fever cases. The authors believe that there is a need to expand genomic surveillance to provide a more comprehensive window into the emergence, expansion, and spread of antibiotic-resistant organisms.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;", "link": "https://news.abplive.com/science/typhoid-causing-bacteria-becoming-increasingly-resistant-to-antibiotics-lancet-study-1538544", "published_js": "2022-06-22", "author": "Radifah Kabir"}, {"title": "BAPS launches research institute in US", "summary": "&lt;p&gt; Washington, Jun 22 (PTI): Driven by the increasing interest in Sanskrit language and traditional Indian knowledge, a top Hindu spiritual organization has launched a first of its kind research institute in the United States.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The BAPS Swaminarayan Research Institute in New Jersey was formally inaugurated by Mahant Swami Maharaj, who joined the ceremony virtually from Ahmedabad, with the lighting of the inaugural lamp, symbolizing the spreading of the light of knowledge throughout the world, a media release said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The institute, based out of Robbinsville in New Jersey, through its rigorous teaching of Sanskrit, Vedic and classical literature, as well as Hindu beliefs, values and practices, will strive to foster social harmony, interfaith dialogue, public engagement and academic discourse, the release said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The impetus for the institute has been a growing interest from members of  the community to learn Sanskrit and gain a deeper understanding of Hindu scriptures.

In this capacity, Dr Prabhakar will be the President\u2019s Chief Advisor for Science and Technology, a co-chair of the President\u2019s Council of Advisors on Science and Technology, and a member of the President\u2019s Cabinet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Further if confirmed to lead OSTP, Prabhakar would become the third Asian American, Native Hawaiian, or Pacific Islander to serve in President Biden\u2019s Cabinet, joining Vice President Kamala Harris and US Trade Representative Katherine Tai.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; \u201cToday\u2019s nomination is historic, with Prabhakar being the first woman, immigrant, or person of colour nominated to serve as Senate-confirmed director of OSTP,\u201d the White House said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Prabhakar has been unanimously confirmed by the Senate before, to lead the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), and was the first woman to hold that role. She later served as director of the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), the birthplace of breakthrough technologies like stealth aircraft and the Internet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Indian Americans have welcomed the nomination.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &quot;Indian American Impact is thrilled to learn that President Biden intends to nominate Dr Arati Prabhakar as Director of the Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP). We applaud the President for his historic decision, which uplifts not only the exceptionally qualified Dr Prabhakar, but all South Asians and Asian Americans who aspire to reach new heights and become leaders within public service and the scientific community,\u201d said Neil Makhija from the Indian American Impact Fund.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; \u201cIt\u2019s incredible to see the President nominate Dr Prabhakar to be the first woman, first person of colour, and the first immigrant to lead OSTP as we observe Immigrant Heritage Month this June,\u201d said Varun Nikore, executive director of AAPI Victory Alliance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;  So far, Dr. Prabhakar has led two different federal R&amp;D agencies and worked with startups, large companies, universities, government labs, and nonprofits across a wide variety of sectors to create powerful new solutions for critical challenges. She is an engineer and applied physicist with extensive management and leadership credentials.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Prabhakar served as director of DARPA from 2012 to 2017. At DARPA, she oversaw teams that prototyped a system for detecting nuclear and radiological materials before a terrorist can build a bomb, that developed tools to find human trafficking networks in the deep and dark web, and that enabled complex military systems to work together even when they were not originally designed to do so. She also established a new office to spur novel biotechnologies, the White House said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Under her leadership, DARPA kick-started the development of a rapid-response mRNA vaccine platform, making possible the fastest safe and effective vaccine development in world history in response to COVID-19, it said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Prabhakar was unanimously confirmed by the US Senate to lead the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), taking the helm at age 34 as the first woman to lead the agency, the White House said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;  Prabhakar\u2019s family immigrated from India to the United States when she was three years old \u2013 first to Chicago and then settling when she was age 10 in Lubbock, Texas, where she went on to get her electrical engineering degree from Texas Tech University.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; She was the first woman to earn a PhD in applied physics from the California Institute of Technology, where she also earned an MS in electrical engineering. She started her career in the legislative branch as a Congressional Fellow at the Office of Technology Assessment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; She is a fellow of the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers and a member of the National Academy of Engineering, and was a fellow at the Center for Advanced Study in the Behavioral Sciences at Stanford University.

The warm ties between Tel Aviv-Yafo and India and between our two countries may be seen in joint projects in many fields, and this is only one example&quot;, Tel Aviv's Mayor, Ron Huldai, told the gathering.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &quot;No one was surprised when the UN decided on International Yoga Day eight years ago. Yoga is the unity of body and mind&quot;, Huldai noted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &quot;This year, India, like Little Israel, is celebrating 75 years of independence, and the two countries are marking 30 years since the establishment of diplomatic relations between them. This number is barely blinking in the millenial ancient psyche of our two peoples.  And it's good that we have so much more to do together&quot;, he further added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A country with probably the highest number of practitioners and Yoga teachers per capita of population, Israelis held Yoga sessions in parks even during the lockdown period while following COVID-19 norms, maintaining social distancing and limiting numbers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Despite Tuesday being a working day, Yoga enthusiasts in Israel found time to arrange several events in parks, beaches, promenades, old railway station turned social gathering spots and other picturesque spots across the country starting early in the morning going into late evening.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &quot;Yoga is one of the most precious gifts from India to the world. And it\u2019s a time-tested technique for lowering stress, building resilience and fostering a centeredness of mind - all of which are increasingly vital in our lives today, especially in the wake of COVID-19\u201d, India's Ambassador to Israel, Sanjeev Singla, told the gathering at Park Ha-Tachana.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Almost every form of Yoga has patrons in Israel but Ashtanga Yoga with 95 centres across the country is clearly the favourite. Vinyasa and Vijnana with more than fifty centres across the country rank among the next favourites.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; There are more than 1,100 registered Yoga teachers in Israel and Yoga centres can be found in almost every major township of the country.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Another popular stream of Yoga is the Iyengar School of Yoga which has 30 centres across the country.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Its centre in Jerusalem's Talpiyot area has organised an open week from June 19 to 24 on the occasion of International Yoga Day to familiarise interested Israelis with the form amid growing interest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Ephrat Michelson, the Yoga teacher at the Talpiyot centre in Jerusalem says, &quot;for the yogis, every day is the day of yoga&quot;, quoting her gurus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &quot;Preschool yoga, prenatal yoga, workplace yoga, yoga for soldiers\u2026 yoga in its many forms has found its way into virtually every area of Israeli life. Even government ministries and the Jerusalem prosecutor\u2019s office offer weekly yoga sessions to workers&quot;, Chen Eytan, a Yoga teacher, who volunteers at schools and kindergartens, pointed out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Ayo Oppenheimer, a Yoga teacher whose daily sessions at the Gan Sachar (Sachar park) in Jerusalem attracts hundreds of people during normal times organised two events to celebrate the International Yoga Day on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &quot;The first class was a mind-clearing Vinyasa flow class focusing on the theme 'be here now' that was held at the Urban Place coworking space in the center of Jerusalem. The space is an entire floor of the Jerusalem Central Bus station and is a working hub for many types of people&quot;, Ayo told PTI.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The second class was a gorgeous and scenic sunset yoga practice on one of the tallest rooftops in the heart of Jerusalem, overlooking the Israeli Parliament, Supreme Court, Gan Sacher Park and the city center. It was more of a gentle Vinyasa-Hath hybrid, what I call 'body bliss yoga', and was a gentle way to breathe, stretch, unwind from the day, open the body and the hips and welcome in the evening.  It featured breath work and extended periods of observation - the colour of the sky, the movement of the clouds overhead, the emergence of the first star, etc.&quot;, she enthusiastically narrates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Besides the big event at Park Ha-Tachana in Tel Aviv, the Indian embassy organised a special Yoga event at Ganei HaYehoshua on June 18 and also a public yoga event in the city of Ashdod in association with Ergun Shevet Oley Hodu and the Municipality of Ashdod on 20th June.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Ashdod has the highest concentration of Indian Jews in Israel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The event at the Park Ha-Tachana, jointly organised by the Embassy of India and Tel Aviv-Yafo municipality, was moderated by Meyran Menkes, a well known Israeli actress who also happens to be a yoga teacher.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;  Israeli musician Ron Paz chanted the Shanti mantra, Yoga students of ICCR Israel performed rhythmic and artistic Yoga, Israeli Yoga Teacher Eyal Chehanowski led Sun Salutations in Hebrew, Indian Yoga Teacher Uday Kumar Saama conducted common Yoga protocol and Ron Paz and team concluded the gala event with a musical performance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Yoga's popularity in Israel can be made out from the fact that it is taught across the country at schools and even kindergartens and the youngsters here are generally aware of its Indian origin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Among many interesting facets of the Israeli Yoga scene is the new growing trend of pregnant women practicing it during the nine month period.
