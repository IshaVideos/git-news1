He added that almost 7.5 million deaths were prevented in countries covered by the Covid-19 Vaccine Access Initiative (COVAX).&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Dr Watson said the initiative was set up because it was clear early on that global vaccine equity would be the only way out of the pandemic. The findings show that millions of lives have likely been saved by making vaccines available to people everywhere, regardless of their wealth.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;However, more lives could have been saved, if the targets set out by the WHO had been achieved, Dr Watson said. Roughly one in five of the estimated lives lost due to Covid-19 in low-income countries could have been prevented, if the targets set out by the WHO had been achieved.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Almost Two-Thirds Of World&amp;rsquo;s Population Has Received At Least One Dose Of Covid Vaccine&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;According to the study, almost two-thirds of the world's population has received at least one dose of a Covid-19 vaccine, since the first Covid-19 vaccine was administered outside of a clinical trial setting on December 8, 2020. The Covid-19 Vaccine Access Initiative (COVAX) had an initial target of giving two vaccine doses to 20 per cent of the population in countries covered by the commitment by the end of 2021. It has facilitated access to affordable vaccines for lower income countries to try to reduce inequalities. The WHO expanded the target of COVAX by setting a global strategy to fully vaccinate 70 per cent of the world's population by mid-2022, with an interim target of vaccinating 40 per cent of the population in all countries by the end of 2021.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;More Than 3.5 Million Covid-19 Deaths Reported Since Administration Of First Vaccine&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;More than 3.5 million Covid-19 deaths have been reported since the first vaccine was administered in December 2020, despite the incredible speed of the global vaccine rollout.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;New Study Is First To Access Number Of Deaths Averted Both Directly And Indirectly&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;The studies which attempted to estimate the impact of vaccination on the course of the pandemic have focused on specific regions, such as individual countries, states, or cities. The study published in The Lancet Infectious Diseases journal is the first to estimate the impact of Covid-19 vaccinations on a global scale and the first to assess the number of deaths averted both directly and indirectly.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Gregory Barnsley, co-first author on the paper, said quantifying the impact that vaccination has made globally is challenging because access to vaccines varies between countries, as does everyone's understanding of which Covid-19 variants have been circulating. Also, very limited genetic sequence data is available for many countries. The number of deaths that could have occurred without vaccinations cannot be directly measured. The alternative scenarios, which cannot be directly observed in real life, can be assessed using mathematical modelling, Barnsley said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;The researchers used an established model of Covid-19 transmission using country-level data for officially recorded Covid-19 deaths occurring between December 8, 2020, and December 8, 2021. This helped them estimate the impact of global vaccination programmes.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Separate Analysis Based On Number Of Excess Deaths Recorded Conducted&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;The researchers carried out a separate analysis based on the number of excess deaths recorded above those that would have been expected during the same time period, to account for under-reporting of deaths in countries with weaker surveillance systems. The researchers used estimates of all-cause excess mortality to account for under-reporting of deaths in the places where official data was not available. Then, they compared the analyses with an alternative hypothetical scenario in which no vaccines were delivered.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Factors The Model Accounted For&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;According to the study, the model accounted for variation in vaccination rates between countries, and also the differences in vaccine efficacy in each country based on the vaccine types known to have been predominantly used in those areas. The scientists did not include China in the analysis owing to its large population and very strict lockdown measures, which would have skewed the findings.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Estimated 18.1 Million Deaths Would Have Occurred During Study Period In Absence Of Vaccination&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;The scientists found that an estimated 18.1 million would have occurred during the study period if vaccinations had not been implemented. They made the estimates based on officially recorded Covid-19 deaths.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;According to the study, the model estimates that vaccination has prevented 14.4 million deaths. This represents a global reduction of 79 per cent.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Vaccination Prevented 19.8 Million Deaths Out Of A Total Of 31.4 Million Potential Deaths&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;The scientists conducted a further analysis based on total excess deaths during the same time period to account for the under-reporting of deaths. The study found that Covid-19 vaccination prevented an estimated 19.8 million deaths out of a total of 31.4 million potential deaths that would have occurred without vaccination. This represents a reduction of 63 per cent.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;15.5 Million Deaths Averted Were Due To Direct Protection&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;According to the study, more than three quarters of deaths averted were due to the direct protection against severe symptoms provided by vaccination. This led to lower mortality rates. As many as 15.5 million deaths out of 19.8 million deaths were averted due to the direct protection against severe symptoms provided by vaccination, accounting for 79 per cent of the deaths averted.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4.3 Million Deaths Averted Due To Indirect Protection&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Indirect protection from reduced transmission of the virus, and reduced burden on healthcare systems could have helped prevent an estimated 4.3 million deaths, the study found. Reduction of the burden on healthcare systems helped improve access to medical care for those most in need.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Greatest Number Of Deaths Averted In First Half Of 2021 Seen In Lower-Middle Income Countries&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;The study found that vaccine impact changed over time and in different areas of the world as the pandemic progressed. The greatest number of deaths averted by vaccination was seen in lower middle-income countries, in the first half of 2021. This resulted from the significant epidemic wave in India as the Delta variant emerged. In the second half of 2021, the greatest impact of vaccination was concentrated in higher income countries. This is because restrictions on travel and social mixing were eased in some areas, leading to greater virus transmission.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;High And Upper-Middle Income Countries Accounted For Greatest Number Of Deaths Averted&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;The study found that the number of estimated deaths prevented per person was greatest in high income countries. This reflects the earlier and wider rollout of vaccination campaigns in these areas. As many as 66 deaths were prevented per 10,000 people in high-income countries, while 2.711 deaths per 10,000 people were prevented in low-income countries.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;According to the study, high and upper-middle income countries accounted for the greatest number of deaths averted, highlighting the inequalities in access to vaccines around the world.

In these countries, an estimated 7.4 million deaths were averted out of a potential 17.9 million, accounting for 41 per cent of the total deaths prevented.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Estimated 1,56,900 Deaths Occurred Because Of Failure To Meet COVAX Target&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;However, the study estimates that the failure to meet the COVAX target of fully vaccinating 20 per cent of the population in some countries resulted in an additional 1,56,900 deaths. The preventable deaths were concentrated in 31 African nations, in which 1,32,700 deaths could have been averted if the target had been met, the study found.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Additional 5,99,300 Deaths Could Have Been Prevented If WHO Target Was Met&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;An additional 5,99,300 deaths, that could have been prevented, are estimated to have occurred worldwide due to the shortfall in the WHO target of fully vaccinating 40 per cent of the population of each country by the end of 2021. The study found lower-middle income countries to account for the majority of these deaths. As many as 3,47,500 deaths out of 5,99,300 deaths worldwide occurred in lower-middle income countries due to the shortfall in the WHO target of fully vaccinating 40 per cent of the population of each country by the end of 2021. This means that 59.7 per cent of the deaths worldwide could have been prevented in the lower-middle income countries.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Most Of The Preventable Deaths Occurred In Africa And East Mediterranean Regions&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Most of these deaths were focused in Africa and East Mediterranean regions. As many as 3,48,900 deaths out of 5,99,300 deaths worldwide were concentrated in Africa, while 1,26,800 deaths out of 5,99,300 deaths worldwide were concentrated in the Eastern Mediterranean regions.

As many as 1,80,300 deaths are estimated to have been averted in all low-income countries under current vaccination rates. Had WHO's target been met in all low-income countries, an additional 200,000 deaths would have been prevented, the study found.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Important To Ensure Most Vulnerable People In All Parts Of World Are Protected From Covid-19&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Professor Azra Ghani, one of the authors on the paper, said the study demonstrates the enormous benefit that vaccines had in reducing deaths from Covid-19 globally. She added that while the intense focus on the pandemic has now shifted, it is important to ensure that the most vulnerable people in all parts of the world are protected from ongoing circulation of Covid-19 and from the other major diseases that continue to disproportionately affect the poorest.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Ghani further said that ensuring fair access to vaccines is crucial, but requires more than just donating vaccines. She added that improvements in vaccine distribution and infrastructure, as well as coordinated efforts to combat vaccine misinformation and improve vaccine demand, are needed, because only then can it be ensured that everyone has the opportunity to benefit from these life-saving technologies.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Limitations To The Study&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;The authors noted several limitations to the study, including the fact that the model is based on a number of necessary assumptions. These assumptions include the precise proportion of which vaccine types have been delivered, how they were delivered and their precise timing of when new virus variants arrived in each country.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;The authors also assumed that the relationship between age and the proportion of Covid-19 deaths occurring among infected individuals is the same for each country. The scientists noted that the findings from the study should be considered in the context of uncertainty in calculating the true death toll of the pandemic, owing to the difference in country-level reporting of Covid-19 mortality.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;", "link": "https://news.abplive.com/science/covid-19-vaccines-prevented-19-8-million-deaths-worldwide-in-first-year-of-rollout-study-in-lancet-1538921", "published_js": "2022-06-24", "author": "Radifah Kabir"}, {"title": "US Senate Passes Gun Safety Bill Hours After Supreme Court Ruling In Favour Of Carrying Guns In Public", "summary": "&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;New Delhi: &lt;/strong&gt;Hours after the US Supreme Court ruled in favour of carrying handguns in public, the US Senate has passed a bipartisan gun violence bill, according to AP. 15 Republicans joined 50 Democrats to rule in favour of the gun safety bill, this allows background checks, beef security in schools and providing funding for mental health programs.

We have seen the governments of dictators and they all had one thing in common, take loans to solve the problems and then take more loans to pay back the previous loan.&quot; He said that this never-ending cycle is still going on and now Pakistan has reached a point when nobody is willing to give the country any further loans. &quot;We could not solve the economic problems of our country when the population was 11 crores during the regime of Zia ul Haq. How our incompetent and failed rulers are going to improve the economy when the population has doubled to 22 crores?&quot; he questioned in his column piece, reported local media.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, China has made a hard bargain with Pakistan when it comes to paybacks on its loans and other investments in Pakistan. In the fiscal year 2021-2022, Pakistan paid around USD 150 million towards interest to China for using a USD 4.5 billion Chinese trade finance facility. In the financial year 2019-2020, Pakistan paid USD 120 million towards interest on USD 3 billion in loans.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;China has been quite stringent in recovering money from Pakistan. Take Pakistan's energy sector for instance, where Chinese investors have repeatedly insisted on resolving issues relating to existing project sponsors in order to attract fresh investment.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Some Chinese projects in Pakistan are facing problems in securing insurance for their loans in China due to Pakistan's massive energy sector circular debt of about USD14 billion.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;While China is heavily responsible for Pakistan's debt problem, it is the mishandling of Pakistan's economy by successive governments that have led to the current impasse.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Extensive loans taken from China, Saudi Arabia and Qatar as well as 13 loans from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) over 30 years (with most loan programmes called off mid-way for failure to fulfil loan conditions), are a major cause of the economic downturn.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The 2019 USD 6 billion IMF loan is also on hold, and China has dealt with Pakistan's frequent requests to help. Ironically, Pakistan on its part is not shy of playing the loan addict. This strategy has not paid the dividends and is only making Pakistan sink deeper into debt.

Watson said.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;According to the estimates by The Economist, 2.3 million people died in India from COVID-19 by the start of May 2021, as against official figures of around 2,00,000.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The WHO had last month estimated that there were 4.7 million Covid-linked deaths in India, a figure that was refuted by the government.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Of the almost 20 million deaths estimated to have been prevented in the first year after vaccines were introduced, almost 7.5 million deaths were prevented in countries covered by the COVID-19 Vaccine Access initiative (COVAX), the researchers said.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;COVAX was set up because it was clear early on that global vaccine equity would be the only way out of the pandemic, they said.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The initiative has facilitated access to affordable vaccines for lower-income countries to try to reduce inequalities, with an initial target of giving both vaccine doses to 20 per cent of the population in countries covered by the commitment by the end of 2021, the researchers said.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Since the first COVID-19 vaccine was administered outside of a clinical trial setting on December 8, 2020, almost two-thirds of the world's population has received at least one dose of a COVID-19 vaccine (66 per cent), they noted.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Despite the incredible speed of the vaccine roll-out worldwide, more than 3.5 million COVID-19 deaths have been reported since the first vaccine was administered in December 2020, they said.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;To estimate the impact of the global vaccination programmes, the researchers used an established model of COVID-19 transmission using country-level data for officially recorded COVID-19 deaths occurring between December 8, 2020 and December 8 2021.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;To account for the under-reporting of deaths in countries with weaker surveillance systems, they carried out a separate analysis based on the number of excess deaths recorded above those that would have been expected during the same time period.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;China was not included in the analysis owing to its large population and very strict lockdown measures which would have skewed the findings, the researchers said.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The team found that based on officially recorded COVID-19 deaths, an estimated 18.1 million deaths would have occurred during the study period if vaccinations had not been implemented.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Of these, the model estimates that vaccination has prevented 14.4 million deaths, representing a global reduction of 79 per cent.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;These findings do not account for the under-reporting of COVID-19 deaths, which is common in lower-income countries.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The team did a further analysis based on total excess deaths during the same time period to account for this.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;They found that COVID-19 vaccination prevented an estimated 19.8 million deaths out of a total of 31.4 million potential deaths that would have occurred without vaccination, a reduction of 63 per cent.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;More than three quarters (79 per cent) of deaths averted were due to the direct protection against severe symptoms provided by the vaccination, leading to lower mortality rates, the researchers said.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The remaining 4.3 million averted deaths were estimated to have been prevented by indirect protection from reduced transmission of the virus in the population and reduced burden on healthcare systems, thereby improving access to medical care for those most in need, they said.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The study found that the vaccine impact changed over time and in different areas of the world as the pandemic progressed.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;In the first half of 2021, the greatest number of deaths averted by vaccination was seen in lower middle-income countries, resulting from the significant epidemic wave in India as the Delta variant emerged.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;This subsequently shifted to the greatest impact being concentrated in higher-income countries in the second half of 2021, as restrictions on travel and social mixing were eased in some areas leading to greater virus transmission.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The shortfall in the WHO target of fully vaccinating 40 per cent of the population of each country by the end of 2021 is estimated to have contributed to an additional 5,99,300 deaths worldwide that could have been prevented.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Lower-middle-income countries accounted for the majority of these deaths.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&quot;Our study demonstrates the enormous benefit that vaccines had in reducing deaths from COVID-19 globally,&quot; said Professor Azra Ghani, Chair in Infectious Disease Epidemiology at Imperial College London.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&quot;Whilst the intense focus on the pandemic has now shifted, it is important that we ensure the most vulnerable people in all parts of the world are protected from the ongoing circulation of COVID-19 and from the other major diseases that continue to disproportionately affect the poorest,&quot; Ghani said.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The authors note several limitations to their findings. Notably, their model is based on a number of necessary assumptions, including the precise proportions of which vaccine types have been delivered, how they were delivered and the precise timing of when new virus variants arrived in each country.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;They also assumed that the relationship between age and the proportion of &lt;a title=&quot;COVID-19&quot; href=&quot;https://news.abplive.com/topic/coronavirus-india&quot; data-type=&quot;interlinkingkeywords&quot;&gt;COVID-19&lt;/a&gt; deaths occurring among infected individuals is the same for each country.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DISCLAIMER: This report has been published as part of the auto-generated syndicate wire feed.

According to a report by news agency AFP, no human cases of polio have been found in Britain where the disease was eradicated two decades back. More analysis on the latest development is underway, officials said.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;According to a statement issued by WHO, &quot;type 2 vaccine-derived poliovirus (VDPV2)&quot; has been found in environmental samples in the British capital.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&quot;It is important to note that the virus has been isolated from environmental samples only,&quot; the statement said, adding that &quot;no associated cases of paralysis have been detected.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;However, the WHO warned that &quot;any form of poliovirus anywhere is a threat to children everywhere.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;According to David Elliman, a consultant paediatrician at Great Ormond Street Hospital, parents often ask why vaccines continue to be given against polio even after it has been eliminated in the UK.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&quot;The answer is that, although we are an island, we are not isolated from the rest of the world, which means diseases could be brought in from abroad,&quot; AFP quoted the doctor as saying.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&quot;The finding of vaccine-derived polio virus in sewage proves the point,&amp;rdquo; he added.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Notably, an international effort in recent decades has come close to fully eradicating the crippling viral disease that mainly affects children below the age of five. &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;As per the AFP report, polio cases have gone down by 99 percent since 1988 when the disease was endemic in 125 countries and 350,000 cases were recorded across the globe.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The wild version of the polio virus now exists in Afghanistan and Pakistan, but a type of vaccine that contains small amounts of weakened live polio still causes occasional outbreaks elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Polio eradication expert Kathlene O'Reilly said that the discovery in the London sewage samples shows &quot;there may be localised spread of poliovirus, most likely within individuals that are not up to date with polio immunisations&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&quot;The most effective way to prevent further spread is to check vaccination histories, especially of young children, to check that polio vaccination is included,&quot; she added.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;As per WHO, there were 959 confirmed cases of VDPV2 globally in 2020.&lt;/p&gt;", "link": "https://news.abplive.com/news/world/vaccine-derived-polio-virus-found-in-london-sewage-samples-for-first-time-in-decades-report-1538889", "published_js": "2022-06-23", "author": "ABP News Bureau"}, {"title": "Afghan Territory Should Not Be Used To Shelter Or Train Terrorists: BRICS Declaration", "summary": "&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;New Delhi:&lt;/strong&gt; Member nations of the BRICS grouping issued a declaration saying that Afghanistan should not to be used to threaten or attack any country or to shelter or train terrorists. &amp;ldquo;We strongly support a peaceful, secure and stable Afghanistan while emphasising respect for its sovereignty, independence, territorial integrity,&amp;rdquo; the declaration said.
