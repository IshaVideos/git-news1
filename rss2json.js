The majority opinion had then found termination of pregnancy during the first three months an absolute right.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The name of the lawsuit was Roe Vs Wade.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The plaintiff in the case was Norma McCorvey, a 22-year-old unmarried and unemployed Texas woman, and Jane Roe was actually a pseudonym.&amp;nbsp;She was pregnant for the third time in 1969, and sought to have an abortion. The US Supreme Court ruling came in her favour in 1973, though she had by then delivered a baby girl who she later put up for adoption, according to an AP report.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Roe had sued Henry Wade, the district attorney of Dallas County, Texas, whose job was to enforce a state law that prohibited abortion except in cases where the mother&amp;rsquo;s life is in danger.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;In her petition, Roe had alleged that the Texas law was &amp;ldquo;unconstitutionally vague and violated her constitutionally protected right to personal privacy&amp;rdquo;, the AP report said. Her question before the apex court was: &amp;ldquo;Does the Constitution recognize a woman&amp;rsquo;s right to terminate her pregnancy by abortion?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;It did, found the 7-2 majority opinion delivered by Justice Harry Blackmun.

There was a total ban on abortion in the remaining 30 states. The SC decision, however, nullified them because constitutional rights are superior to state laws in the country. The court, nevertheless, allowed states to impose certain regulations during the second trimester, and take steps to protect foetal life in the third.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;In 1992, when Pennsylvania abortion laws were challenged in Blackmun&amp;rsquo;s court, it upheld the right to abortion, but made it easier for states to impose regulations, the AP report said.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Texas state has since banned most abortions after about six weeks.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a title=&quot;ALSO READ | Disney Says It Will Cover Staff Travel Costs For Abortions As US SC Strikes Down Roe Vs Wade: Report&quot; href=&quot;https://news.abplive.com/news/world/disney-says-it-will-cover-staff-travel-costs-for-abortions-as-us-sc-strikes-down-roe-vs-wade-report-1539076&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;dofollow noopener&quot;&gt;ALSO READ | Disney Says It Will Cover Staff Travel Costs For Abortions As US SC Strikes Down Roe Vs Wade: Report&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What Happens In The US Now?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;As aniticipated after the draft was leaked, the overturning of &amp;lsquo;Roe Vs Wade&amp;rsquo; leaves abortion laws entirely up to the states, since there is no federal law that protects the right to abortion in the US.

He added that almost 7.5 million deaths were prevented in countries covered by the Covid-19 Vaccine Access Initiative (COVAX).&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Dr Watson said the initiative was set up because it was clear early on that global vaccine equity would be the only way out of the pandemic.

Roughly one in five of the estimated lives lost due to Covid-19 in low-income countries could have been prevented, if the targets set out by the WHO had been achieved.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Almost Two-Thirds Of World&amp;rsquo;s Population Has Received At Least One Dose Of Covid Vaccine&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;According to the study, almost two-thirds of the world's population has received at least one dose of a Covid-19 vaccine, since the first Covid-19 vaccine was administered outside of a clinical trial setting on December 8, 2020. The Covid-19 Vaccine Access Initiative (COVAX) had an initial target of giving two vaccine doses to 20 per cent of the population in countries covered by the commitment by the end of 2021. It has facilitated access to affordable vaccines for lower income countries to try to reduce inequalities. The WHO expanded the target of COVAX by setting a global strategy to fully vaccinate 70 per cent of the world's population by mid-2022, with an interim target of vaccinating 40 per cent of the population in all countries by the end of 2021.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;More Than 3.5 Million Covid-19 Deaths Reported Since Administration Of First Vaccine&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;More than 3.5 million Covid-19 deaths have been reported since the first vaccine was administered in December 2020, despite the incredible speed of the global vaccine rollout.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;New Study Is First To Access Number Of Deaths Averted Both Directly And Indirectly&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;The studies which attempted to estimate the impact of vaccination on the course of the pandemic have focused on specific regions, such as individual countries, states, or cities. The study published in The Lancet Infectious Diseases journal is the first to estimate the impact of Covid-19 vaccinations on a global scale and the first to assess the number of deaths averted both directly and indirectly.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Gregory Barnsley, co-first author on the paper, said quantifying the impact that vaccination has made globally is challenging because access to vaccines varies between countries, as does everyone's understanding of which Covid-19 variants have been circulating. Also, very limited genetic sequence data is available for many countries. The number of deaths that could have occurred without vaccinations cannot be directly measured. The alternative scenarios, which cannot be directly observed in real life, can be assessed using mathematical modelling, Barnsley said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;The researchers used an established model of Covid-19 transmission using country-level data for officially recorded Covid-19 deaths occurring between December 8, 2020, and December 8, 2021. This helped them estimate the impact of global vaccination programmes.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Separate Analysis Based On Number Of Excess Deaths Recorded Conducted&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;The researchers carried out a separate analysis based on the number of excess deaths recorded above those that would have been expected during the same time period, to account for under-reporting of deaths in countries with weaker surveillance systems. The researchers used estimates of all-cause excess mortality to account for under-reporting of deaths in the places where official data was not available. Then, they compared the analyses with an alternative hypothetical scenario in which no vaccines were delivered.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Factors The Model Accounted For&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;According to the study, the model accounted for variation in vaccination rates between countries, and also the differences in vaccine efficacy in each country based on the vaccine types known to have been predominantly used in those areas. The scientists did not include China in the analysis owing to its large population and very strict lockdown measures, which would have skewed the findings.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Estimated 18.1 Million Deaths Would Have Occurred During Study Period In Absence Of Vaccination&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;The scientists found that an estimated 18.1 million would have occurred during the study period if vaccinations had not been implemented.

The study found that Covid-19 vaccination prevented an estimated 19.8 million deaths out of a total of 31.4 million potential deaths that would have occurred without vaccination. This represents a reduction of 63 per cent.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;15.5 Million Deaths Averted Were Due To Direct Protection&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;According to the study, more than three quarters of deaths averted were due to the direct protection against severe symptoms provided by vaccination. This led to lower mortality rates. As many as 15.5 million deaths out of 19.8 million deaths were averted due to the direct protection against severe symptoms provided by vaccination, accounting for 79 per cent of the deaths averted.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4.3 Million Deaths Averted Due To Indirect Protection&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Indirect protection from reduced transmission of the virus, and reduced burden on healthcare systems could have helped prevent an estimated 4.3 million deaths, the study found. Reduction of the burden on healthcare systems helped improve access to medical care for those most in need.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Greatest Number Of Deaths Averted In First Half Of 2021 Seen In Lower-Middle Income Countries&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;The study found that vaccine impact changed over time and in different areas of the world as the pandemic progressed. The greatest number of deaths averted by vaccination was seen in lower middle-income countries, in the first half of 2021. This resulted from the significant epidemic wave in India as the Delta variant emerged. In the second half of 2021, the greatest impact of vaccination was concentrated in higher income countries. This is because restrictions on travel and social mixing were eased in some areas, leading to greater virus transmission.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;High And Upper-Middle Income Countries Accounted For Greatest Number Of Deaths Averted&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;The study found that the number of estimated deaths prevented per person was greatest in high income countries. This reflects the earlier and wider rollout of vaccination campaigns in these areas. As many as 66 deaths were prevented per 10,000 people in high-income countries, while 2.711 deaths per 10,000 people were prevented in low-income countries.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;According to the study, high and upper-middle income countries accounted for the greatest number of deaths averted, highlighting the inequalities in access to vaccines around the world. As many as 12.2 million deaths out of an estimated 19.8 million deaths were averted in the high and upper-middle income countries.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;As many as 83 countries that are covered by the COVAX commitment to affordable vaccines were included in the analysis. In these countries, an estimated 7.4 million deaths were averted out of a potential 17.9 million, accounting for 41 per cent of the total deaths prevented.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Estimated 1,56,900 Deaths Occurred Because Of Failure To Meet COVAX Target&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;However, the study estimates that the failure to meet the COVAX target of fully vaccinating 20 per cent of the population in some countries resulted in an additional 1,56,900 deaths. The preventable deaths were concentrated in 31 African nations, in which 1,32,700 deaths could have been averted if the target had been met, the study found.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Additional 5,99,300 Deaths Could Have Been Prevented If WHO Target Was Met&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;An additional 5,99,300 deaths, that could have been prevented, are estimated to have occurred worldwide due to the shortfall in the WHO target of fully vaccinating 40 per cent of the population of each country by the end of 2021. The study found lower-middle income countries to account for the majority of these deaths. As many as 3,47,500 deaths out of 5,99,300 deaths worldwide occurred in lower-middle income countries due to the shortfall in the WHO target of fully vaccinating 40 per cent of the population of each country by the end of 2021. This means that 59.7 per cent of the deaths worldwide could have been prevented in the lower-middle income countries.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Most Of The Preventable Deaths Occurred In Africa And East Mediterranean Regions&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Most of these deaths were focused in Africa and East Mediterranean regions. As many as 3,48,900 deaths out of 5,99,300 deaths worldwide were concentrated in Africa, while 1,26,800 deaths out of 5,99,300 deaths worldwide were concentrated in the Eastern Mediterranean regions. These accounted for 58.2 per cent and 21.2 per cent of the total deaths that could have been prevented worldwide, respectively.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;According to the study, the number of deaths averted by vaccination in these areas would have more than doubled, if the 40 per cent target had been met in all low-income countries. As many as 1,80,300 deaths are estimated to have been averted in all low-income countries under current vaccination rates. Had WHO's target been met in all low-income countries, an additional 200,000 deaths would have been prevented, the study found.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Important To Ensure Most Vulnerable People In All Parts Of World Are Protected From Covid-19&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Professor Azra Ghani, one of the authors on the paper, said the study demonstrates the enormous benefit that vaccines had in reducing deaths from Covid-19 globally. She added that while the intense focus on the pandemic has now shifted, it is important to ensure that the most vulnerable people in all parts of the world are protected from ongoing circulation of Covid-19 and from the other major diseases that continue to disproportionately affect the poorest.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Ghani further said that ensuring fair access to vaccines is crucial, but requires more than just donating vaccines. She added that improvements in vaccine distribution and infrastructure, as well as coordinated efforts to combat vaccine misinformation and improve vaccine demand, are needed, because only then can it be ensured that everyone has the opportunity to benefit from these life-saving technologies.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Limitations To The Study&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;The authors noted several limitations to the study, including the fact that the model is based on a number of necessary assumptions.

After two incidents of gun violence last month in New York and Texas, both parties emerged with a compromise embodying an incremental but impactful movement to curb the bloodshed.&amp;nbsp; While it fell short of robust gun restrictions Democrats have sought for years, including bans on the assault-type weapons and high-capacity ammunition magazines used in the slayings in Buffalo, New York, and Uvalde, Texas.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Both parties, however, declare victory and demonstrate to voters that they know how to compromise and make government work, while also leaving room for each side to appeal to its core supporters.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ALSO READ: &lt;span style=&quot;color: #e03e2d;&quot;&gt;&lt;a style=&quot;color: #e03e2d;&quot; href=&quot;https://news.abplive.com/news/world/us-supreme-court-allows-citizens-to-carry-guns-in-public-as-fundamental-right-prez-biden-denounces-decision-1538917&quot;&gt;US Supreme Court Allows Citizens To Carry Guns In Public As Fundamental Right, Prez Biden Denounces Decision&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;According to AP, the bill would make the local juvenile records of people aged 18 to 20 available during required federal background checks when they attempt to buy guns.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;People convicted of domestic abuse who are current or former romantic partners of the victim would be prohibited from acquiring firearms. This ban currently only applies to people married to, living with or who have had children with the victim.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The compromise bill would extend that to those considered to have had &amp;ldquo;a continuing serious relationship&amp;rdquo;, the report stated.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;There would be money to help states enforce red flag laws and for other states without them for violence prevention programs. Nineteen states and the District of Columbia have such laws.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The measure expands the use of background checks by rewriting the definition of the federally licensed gun dealers required to conduct them. Penalties for gun trafficking are strengthened, billions of dollars are provided for behavioural health clinics and school mental health programs and there's money for school safety initiatives, though not for personnel to use a &amp;ldquo;dangerous weapon.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;This is not a cure-all for all the ways gun violence affects our nation,&amp;rdquo; Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer of New York, whose party has made gun restrictions a goal for decades, was quoted as saying by AP. &amp;ldquo;But it is a long-overdue step in the right direction. Passing this gun safety bill is truly significant, and it&amp;rsquo;s going to save lives.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;", "link": "https://news.abplive.com/news/world/us-senate-including-15-republicans-50-democrats-passes-bill-on-gun-safety-including-mental-health-check-boyfriend-loophole-1538929", "published_js": "2022-06-24", "author": "ABP News Bureau"}, {"title": "Pakistan Faces Major Paper Crisis, Warns Unavailability Of Books For Next Academic Year", "summary": "&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;New Delhi:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;Books might not be available to students and others for the next academic session, 2023 in Pakistan as the country's paper association has warned the same following paper crisis in the country. The paper crisis is attributed to global inflation and also wrong policies of the government and the monopoly of the local paper industries. Country's leading economist Qaiser Bengali along with various orgainsations associated with the paper industry warned of unavailability of books to students in the new academic session starting in August.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;There is a severe paper crisis in the country, paper prices are skyrocketing, paper has become so expensive and its price is increasing day by day and publishers are not able to determine the price of books, reported Pakistan's local media outlet.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Due to this, textbook boards of Sindh, Punjab and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa will not be able to print textbooks.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, a Pakistani columnist has raised questions to the country's &quot;incompetent and failed rulers&quot; asking them how they will solve the economic problems at a time when the country is trapped in a vicious cycle of taking loans to pay back the previous loans.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Ayaz Amir, while writing for Pakistan's local media outlet Dunya Daily said, &quot;We have seen the rules of Ayub Khan (Former President of Pakistan), Yahiya Khan, Zulfikar Ali Bhutto and Muhammad Zia-ul-Haq. We have seen the governments of dictators and they all had one thing in common, take loans to solve the problems and then take more loans to pay back the previous loan.&quot; He said that this never-ending cycle is still going on and now Pakistan has reached a point when nobody is willing to give the country any further loans. &quot;We could not solve the economic problems of our country when the population was 11 crores during the regime of Zia ul Haq. How our incompetent and failed rulers are going to improve the economy when the population has doubled to 22 crores?&quot; he questioned in his column piece, reported local media.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, China has made a hard bargain with Pakistan when it comes to paybacks on its loans and other investments in Pakistan. In the fiscal year 2021-2022, Pakistan paid around USD 150 million towards interest to China for using a USD 4.5 billion Chinese trade finance facility. In the financial year 2019-2020, Pakistan paid USD 120 million towards interest on USD 3 billion in loans.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;China has been quite stringent in recovering money from Pakistan. Take Pakistan's energy sector for instance, where Chinese investors have repeatedly insisted on resolving issues relating to existing project sponsors in order to attract fresh investment.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Some Chinese projects in Pakistan are facing problems in securing insurance for their loans in China due to Pakistan's massive energy sector circular debt of about USD14 billion.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;While China is heavily responsible for Pakistan's debt problem, it is the mishandling of Pakistan's economy by successive governments that have led to the current impasse.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Extensive loans taken from China, Saudi Arabia and Qatar as well as 13 loans from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) over 30 years (with most loan programmes called off mid-way for failure to fulfil loan conditions), are a major cause of the economic downturn.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The 2019 USD 6 billion IMF loan is also on hold, and China has dealt with Pakistan's frequent requests to help. Ironically, Pakistan on its part is not shy of playing the loan addict. This strategy has not paid the dividends and is only making Pakistan sink deeper into debt. Pakistan must be closely watching developments in Sri Lanka, for it could be next nation to face the consequences of bad economic policies and heavy debt burdens.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;(With inputs from ANI)&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;", "link": "https://news.abplive.com/news/world/pakistan-faces-major-paper-crisis-warns-unavailability-of-books-for-next-academic-year-1538930", "published_js": "2022-06-24", "author": "ABP News Bureau"}]}, "swarajyamag.com": {"feed": {"title": "swarajyamag.com"}, "entries": [{"title": "U.S Supreme Court Overturns 1973 Roe v.
