New Glucose Meter Can Tell You", "summary": "&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Covid-19 tests can determine whether a person is infected with SARS-CoV-2, but cannot assess how long one who has tested positive for the novel coronavirus is protected against reinfection. A team of researchers has recently reported a simple, accurate glucose-meter-based test incorporating a novel fusion protein. The researchers have described in a new study that consumers could someday use this assay to monitor their own SARS-CoV-2 antibody levels. The study titled &quot;Antibody-Invertase Fusion Protein Enables Quantitative Detection of SARS-CoV-2 Antibodies Using Widely Available Glucometers&quot; was recently published in the &lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Journal of American Chemical Society&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Antibodies Are A Good Indication Of Protection Against SARS-CoV-2&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Though vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 and infection with the virus can guard against future infections for a while, the duration of the protection is not known exactly. A person's level of SARS-CoV-2 is a good indication of immune protection. The enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) is the gold standard measurement, but requires expensive equipment and specialised technicians.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Meanwhile, glucose meters are readily available, easy to use, and can be integrated with remote clinical services. According to the statement, researchers have been adapting glucose meters to sense other target molecules, so that they can perform the dual action of detection and glucose production.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How Does The Glucose Meter Work?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;For instance, if a detection antibody in the test binds to an antibody in a patient's blood, a reaction occurs that produces glucose. This is something that the device detects very well.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Though invertase is an attractive enzyme for this type of analysis as it converts sucrose into glucose, it is difficult to attach the enzyme to detection antibodies with chemical approaches.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Therefore, researchers at the American Chemical Society set out to see whether producing a fusion protein consisting of both invertase and a detection antibody would work in an assay that would allow SARS-CoV-2 antibody levels to be read with a glucose meter.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;According to the study, the scientists designed and produced a novel fusion protein containing both invertase and a mouse antibody that binds to human immunoglobulin (IgG) antibodies. They found that the fusion protein bound to human IgGs and successfully produced glucose from sucrose.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Then, the researchers made test strips with the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein on them. When the strips were dipped in Covid-19 patient samples, the patients' SARS-CoV-2 antibodies bound to the spike protein.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Since the invertase/IgG fusion protein, and sucrose were added to the strips, it led to the production of glucose. This could be detected by the glucose meter. The scientists validated the test by performing the analysis with glucose meters on a variety of patient samples. They found that the new assay worked, along with four different ELISAs. According to the researchers, the method can also be adapted to test for SARS-CoV-2 variants and other infectious diseases.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;", "link": "https://news.abplive.com/science/covid-19-antibodies-can-be-detected-using-new-glucose-meter-1538413", "published_js": "2022-06-21", "author": "Radifah Kabir"}, {"title": "Israel To Go To Elections Again \u2014 5th Time In 3 Years.

Other animals which may show some use of urbanised areas, but still largely rely on natural areas, are known as &quot;urban adapters&quot;. There are some species such as land predators which are very sensitive to human disturbance, and avoid big cities. These animals are known as &quot;urban avoiders&quot;. Wolves are &quot;urban avoiders&quot;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;In a statement released by University of Miami, Neil Hammerschlag, the lead author on the paper, said few studies have investigated the movements of ocean predators in relation to urbanisation, but since other studies have shown that land predators are urban avoiders, the team expected sharks to be too.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sharks Spend A Lot Of Time Near Cities&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;He added that the researchers were surprised to find that the sharks they tracked spent so much time near the lights and sounds of the busy city, often close to shore, no matter the time of day.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;The team conducted that the behaviours of the tracked sharks resembled that of &quot;urban adapters&quot;. According to the study, sharks could be attracted to shore from land-based activities, such as discarding of fish carcasses.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;The tracked sharks were observed to use the urban-impacted areas a lot, and this may have consequences for both sharks and humans.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Hammerschlag said by spending so much time close to the shore, sharks are at risk of exposure to toxic pollutants as well as fishing. This could impact their health and survival.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Shark bites on humans are rare. However, the study stated that areas close to shore could be avoided by human water users to reduce probability of a negative shark encounter. This would promote human-shark coexistence.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ALSO READ | &lt;a title=&quot;Meet Ruchita Sahukari: 22-Year-Old With Osteogenesis Imperfecta Fighting To Make Education Accessible To All&quot; href=&quot;https://news.abplive.com/science/ruchita-sahukari-22-year-old-with-osteogenesis-imperfecta-fighting-to-make-education-accessible-to-all-1538190&quot; target=&quot;&quot;&gt;Meet Ruchita Sahukari: 22-Year-Old With Osteogenesis Imperfecta Fighting To Make Education Accessible To All&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;", "link": "https://news.abplive.com/science/sharks-may-be-much-closer-to-cities-than-you-think-new-research-finds-1538316", "published_js": "2022-06-21", "author": "Radifah Kabir"}, {"title": "Mob Attacks Indians In Maldives During International Yoga Day 2022 Celebration", "summary": "&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Chennai:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt; An International Yoga Day celebration turned violent in Maldives after angry mob entered Maldives national football stadium and attacked the Indians on Tuesday.
