Animals can often carry harmful germs which may spread to people and cause illnesses, known as zoonoses. Pathogens such as viruses, bacteria, parasites, and fungi may cause zoonotic diseases. The pathogens may cause different types of illnesses in people and animals, ranging from mild to serious illness, and sometimes, death.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;There are over 200 known types of zoonoses, which comprise a large percentage of new and existing diseases in humans.

As the Covid-19 pandemic was wreaking havoc in the world, the report warned that further outbreaks will emerge unless governments take active measures to prevent other zoonotic diseases from crossing into the human population.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;The report, which was a joint effort by the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) and the International Livestock Research Institute (ILRI), presented ten recommendations to prevent future pandemics. It identified seven trends driving the increasing emergence of zoonotic diseases. According to the report, Africa, which has experienced and responded to a number of zoonotic epidemics including Ebola outbreaks, could be a source of important solutions to quell future outbreaks.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Which Factors Drive The Emergence Of Zoonotic Diseases?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;The report identified seven human-mediated factors as most likely driving the emergence of zoonotic diseases, the Convention on Biological Diversity said on its website. These are: increasing human demand for animal protein, unsustainable agricultural intensification, increased use and exploitation of wildlife, unsustainable utilisation of natural resources accelerated by urbanisation, land use change and extractive industries, increased travel and transportation, changes in food supply, and climate change.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;The report noted that around 80 per cent of pathogens infecting animals are &quot;multi-host&quot;.

The key recommendations are: Awareness, Governance, Science, Funding, Monitoring and Regulation, Incentives, Biosecurity and Control, Agriculture and Wildlife Habitats, Capacity Building, and Operationalising the One Health approach.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Awareness: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;The aim of World Zoonoses Day is to raise awareness and increase understanding of zoonotic and emerging disease risks and prevention, at all levels of society to build widespread support for risk-reduction strategies.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Governance:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt; In order to highlight the continued importance of prevention of zoonotic diseases on World Zoonoses Day 2021, the report highlighted ten key policy recommendations including governance.

I just want to make absolutely clear that there's no place in this government for anybody who is predatory or abuses their position of power,&quot; he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Sajid Javid, a British citizen of Pakistani origin, in his resignation letter said, &quot;We [Conservative party] may not have always been popular, but we have been competent in acting in the national interest. Sadly, in the current circumstances, the public are concluding that we are now neither.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &quot;The vote of confidence last month showed that a large number of our colleagues agree.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &quot;I regret to say, however, that it is clear to me that this situation will not change under your leadership and you have therefore lost my confidence too,&quot; Javid, 52, said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It was followed up by a few other junior resignations, including Conservative Party Vice-Chair Bim Afolami \u2014 who called on Johnson to resign as he has lost the \u201csupport of the party and the country\u201d.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Saqib Bhatti, parliamentary private secretary (PPS) to now former health secretary Javid, has also resigned. In a statement on Twitter, he said: &quot;The Conservative party has always been the party of integrity and honour but recent events have undermined trust and standards in public life.&quot; \t Jonathan Gullis, PPS to Northern Ireland Secretary Brandon Lewis, has also quit. He said for too long &quot;we have been focused on dealing with our reputational damage rather than delivering for the people&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Opposition Labour Party Leader Keir Starmer declared that it is clear the government is \u201cnow collapsing\u201d.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; \u201cAfter all the sleaze, the scandals and the failure, it's clear that this government is now collapsing. Tory Cabinet ministers have known all along who this prime minister is. They have been his cheerleaders throughout this sorry saga,\u201d he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Even if there are no more resignations, the mood in the ruling Conservative Party has already turned against Johnson - perhaps decisively, The Guardian newspaper commented.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Under current rules Johnson is safe from another leadership challenge until next summer. But the executive of the 1922 Committee can change the rules whenever it wants, it noted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A new anti-Johnson executive is expected to be elected next week, but even the current executive - more evenly split between loyalists and critics - could act now if it felt there was a consensus in the party, the British newspaper wrote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Earlier on Tuesday, Lord Simon McDonald, who was the permanent secretary in the UK Foreign Office between 2015 and 2020, wrote to the Parliament's standards commissioner saying Downing Street made &quot;inaccurate claims&quot; about Chris Pincher - who resigned from the post of Conservative Deputy Chief Whip last week after admitting drunken misbehaviour.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In the wake of the resignation, the Prime Minister\u2019s office said Boris Johnson was not aware of any specific allegations against Pincher when he was appointed to the post.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &quot;This morning I have written to the Parliamentary Commissioner for Standards - because No. 10 [Downing Street] keep changing their story and are still not telling the truth,&quot; McDonald said as he tweeted his letter to the Parliamentary watchdog.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In the letter, he wrote: &quot;The original No. 10 line is not true and the modification is still not accurate. Mr Johnson was briefed in person about the initiation and outcome of the investigation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &quot;There was a 'formal complaint'. Allegations were 'resolved' only in the sense that the investigation was completed; Mr Pincher was not exonerated. To characterise the allegations as 'unsubstantiated' is therefore wrong.&quot; \t Deputy Prime Minister Dominic Raab was asked about these developments on air on Tuesday and defended his boss, saying it was not his understanding that Boris Johnson was directly briefed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; \u201cIn relation to the 2019 allegation or complaint [against Pincher], whilst there was inappropriate behaviour, it didn't trip the wire into disciplinary action,&quot; he told the BBC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Pincher, who was suspended as a Conservative Party MP for Tamworth last week over allegations he groped two men at a private members' club in London, says he is seeking professional medical support and has no intention of resigning as an MP.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Opposition Labour Party said it was clear that Boris Johnson knew about the seriousness of the complaints against Pincher when he appointed him to an important post of Deputy Chief Whip, in charge of party discipline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &quot;He refused to act and then lied about what he knew. Boris Johnson is dragging British democracy through the muck. His appalling judgement has made Westminster a less safe place to work,&quot; said Labour Deputy Leader Angela Rayner.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; For months Prime Minister Johnson has been facing a barrage of criticism and rebellion over his conduct and that of his government, including illegal, Covid-linked lockdown-breaking parties at his Downing Street offices for which he and others were fined by the police.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Last month, Johnson survived a confidence vote, but the final count of his lawmakers who rebelled against him was higher than his supporters expected: 41 per cent of his own Conservative parliamentary party refused to back him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Meanwhile, another senior Indian-origin minister, Home Secretary Priti Patel, has said she has no plans to follow her other South Asian origin colleagues out of Cabinet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; At the same time, Justice Secretary Dominic Raab, Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng, Defence Secretary Ben Wallace, Foreign Secretary Liz Truss, and International Trade Secretary Anne-Marie Trevelyan have also expressed their support for Johnson.

This cleared her body of cancer.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;However, in October 2019, the cancer returned, and her scans showed multiple lesions throughout her body, implying she had a poor prognosis.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;According to the report, the cancer had spread to the lungs, lymph nodes and chest bones. David was told that she had less than a year to live. Then, David was offered the opportunity to be part of research by participating in a Phase I clinical trial.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;David Deemed Cancer-Free By June 2021&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;David said she celebrated her 50th birthday in February 2020 while still in the middle of treatment and not knowing what the future held. &quot;Two and a half years ago I thought it was the end and now I feel like I've been reborn,&quot; she said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;David stated that there is a change in her life after returning to India to see family in April and she has decided to take early retirement and live her life in gratitude to God and medical science. She added that her family has been supportive of this decision, and that she will be celebrating her 25th wedding anniversary in September.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;No measurable cancer cells in her body were seen in her scans. She was deemed cancer-free by June 2021. Though she continues to show no evidence of the disease, she will remain on treatment until December 2023.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;&quot;We are really pleased that Jasmin has such a good outcome. At The Christie, we are continually testing new drugs and therapies to see if they can benefit more people,&quot; Professor Fiona Thistlethwaite, medical oncologist and clinical director of Manchester CRF at The Christie was quoted as saying in the report.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In June, Tumours Disappeared From Every Patient In Drug Trial&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;A similar wonder in the field of oncology occurred in the month of June. For the first time in the history of cancer, tumours had disappeared from every patient involved in a drug trial. As many as 18 rectal cancer patients participated in the trial, and each of them was given the same drug.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Surprisingly, the cancer had vanished and every single patient, and was undetectable by physical examination, endoscopy or Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) scans. The study describing the results was published in the New England Journal of Medicine.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;According to a report published by The New York Times (NYT), Dr Luis A. Diaz Jr of Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center said he knew of no other study in which a treatment completely obliterated a cancer in every patient.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;He said he believes this is the first time this has happened in the history of cancer.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;The study found that on average, one in five patients have some sort of adverse reaction to dostarlimab, the drug the patients took. Dostarlimab is also known as a checkpoint inhibitor. The medication, which was given every three weeks for six months, unmasks cancer cells, allowing the immune system to identify and destroy them, and costs about $11,000 per dose.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Most adverse reactions are easily managed, the report said. However, as many as three to five per cent of patients who take checkpoint inhibitors have more severe complications. In some cases, these complications can result in muscle weakness and difficulty swallowing and chewing.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;", "link": "https://news.abplive.com/health/indian-origin-woman-cancer-free-after-successful-2-year-trial-in-uk-nhs-names-drug-atezolizumab-national-institute-for-health-and-care-research-nihr-manchester-clinical-research-facility-crf-at-christie-nhs-foundation-trust-1540885", "published_js": "2022-07-05", "author": "ABP News Bureau"}, {"title": "'Biggest Drama In Pakistan History': Maryam Nawaz On Imran Khan's Foreign Conspiracy Claim", "summary": "&lt;p&gt;Hitting out at the former Pakistan prime minister Imran Khan, Pakistan Muslim League (N) Vice-President Maryam Nawaz on Monday said the former PM staged &quot;the biggest drama in the history of Pakistan&quot; under the name of a foreign conspiracy, reported news agency ANI.
