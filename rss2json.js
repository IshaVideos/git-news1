This is probably due to widespread antibiotic use in pig farming.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;The highly antibiotic-resistant strain of the superbug MRSA is called CC398. It has become the dominant type of MRSA in European livestock in the past fifty years, and is also a growing cause of human MRSA infections. The new study found that CC398 has maintained its antibiotic resistance over decades in pigs and other livestock, and is capable of rapidly adapting to human hosts while maintaining this antibiotic resistance.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;The study describing the findings was recently published in the journal &lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;eLife&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;. The paper highlights the potential threat that this strain of MRSA poses to public health. CC398 has been associated with increasing numbers of human infections, in people who have and have not had direct contact with livestock.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What Led To The Evolution Of This Highly Resistant Strain?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;In a statement released by the University of Cambridge, Dr Gemma Murray, a lead author on the paper, said historically high levels of antibiotic use may have led to the evolution of this highly antibiotic resistant strain of MRSA on pig farms. She added that the researchers found that the antibiotic resistance in this livestock-associated MRSA is extremely stable, and that it has persisted for several decades. One of the reasons why antibiotic resistance is extremely stable is that the bacteria has spread across different livestock species.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;According to the University of Cambridge, antibiotic use in European livestock is much lower than it has been in the past. However, researchers say that ongoing reductions in antibiotic use on pig farms, due to recent policy changes, are likely to have a limited impact on the presence of this strain of MRSA in pigs because it is so stable.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MRSA Does Not Cause Disease In Pigs&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;The livestock-associated CC398 is found across a broad range of livestock species. The strain is most commonly associated with pigs. The rise in the strain has been particularly evident in Danish pig farms where the proportion of MRSA-positive herds had increased from less than five per cent in 2008 to 90 per cent in 2018. An important fact to note is that MRSA does not cause disease in pigs.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Dr Lucy Weinert, senior author of the paper, said understanding the emergence and success of CC398 in European livestock, and its capacity to infect humans is vitally important in managing the risk it poses to public health.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ability Of CC398 To Infect Humans Is Linked To Three Mobile Genetic Elements&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;According to the study, the success of CC398 in livestock and its ability to infect humans is linked to three mobile genetic elements in the MRSA genome which are chunks of genetic material that give the MRSA certain characteristics. These include the resistance of MRSA to antibiotics and its ability to evade the human immune system.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Two Mobile Genetic Elements Confer Antibiotic Resistance In MRSA&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;The scientists reconstructed the evolutionary history of two particular mobile genetic elements called Tn916 and SCCmec that confer antibiotic resistance in MRSA. They found that the genetic elements have persisted in a stable way in CC398 in pigs over decades and also persist when CC398 jumps to humans. The mobile genetic elements carry with them high levels of resistance to antibiotics commonly used in farming.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A Mobile Genetic Element Helps The MRSA Strain Evade Human Immune System&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;The researchers found a third mobile genetic element which enables the CC398 strain of MRSA to evade the human immune system. The mobile genetic element was found to have frequently disappeared and reappeared over time, in both human-associated and livestock-associated CC398, suggesting that the strain can rapidly adapt to human hosts.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Weinert said cases of livestock-associated MRSA in humans are still only a small fraction of all MRSA cases in human populations. However, the fact that the cases are increasing is a worrying sign, Weinert added.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Zinc Oxide&amp;rsquo;s Effect On Pig Farms&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;The intensification of farming, together with high levels of antibiotic use in livestock, has led to particular concerns about livestock as reservoirs of antibiotic-resistant human infections.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;For many years, zinc oxide has been used on pig farms to prevent diarrhoea in piglets. The European Union will ban the use of zinc oxide from June 2022, due to concerns about its environmental impact and its potential promotion of antibiotic-resistance in livestock.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;However, the study authors believe that the ban may not help reduce the prevalence of CC398 because the genes conferring antibiotic-resistance are not always linked to the genes that confer resistance to zinc treatment.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;MRSA, which was first identified in human patients in 1960, is much harder to treat than other bacterial infections due to its resistance to antibiotics. According to the World Health Organization, MRSA is now one of the world's greatest threats to human health.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;", "link": "https://news.abplive.com/science/highly-antibiotic-resistant-strain-of-methicillin-resistant-staphylococcus-aureus-found-in-pigs-can-spread-to-humans-1539944", "published_js": "2022-06-29", "author": "Radifah Kabir"}, {"title": "This New App Can Identify More Than 3,000 Birds Just By Sound", "summary": "&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Researchers have developed a new application which can identify more than 3,000 birds just by sound. The app, called the BirdNET app, is a free machine-learning powered tool that can identify more than 3,000 birds by sounds alone, and generates reliable scientific data. This makes it easier for people to contribute citizen-science data on birds by simply recording sounds.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;The study describing the findings was recently published June 28 journal&lt;em&gt; Public Library of Science&lt;/em&gt;. The BirdNET app lowers the barrier to citizen science because it does not require bird-identification skills to participate, the study suggests. When people hear a bird chirp or sing, they can simply tap the app to record the sounds. The study was led by researchers at Cornell Lab of Ornithology, Cornell University.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How The BirdNET App Works&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;According to the study, the BirdNET app uses artificial intelligence to automatically identify the species by sound and captures the recording for use in research.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Since the launch of the app in 2018, more than 2.2 million people have contributed data. In order to test whether the app could generate reliable scientific data, the researchers selected four test cases in which conventional research had already provided robust answers. The study found that the BirdNET app data successfully replicated known patterns of song dialects in North American and European songbirds and accurately mapped a bird migration on both continents.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Validating the reliability of the app data for research purposes was the first step in what the researchers hope will be a long-term, global research effort. This research effort will be not just for birds, but ultimately for all wildlife and entire soundscapes.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;In a statement released by Cornell University, Connor Wood, the lead author on the paper, said the most exciting part of the work is how simple it is for people to participate in bird research and conservation.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Wood added that one does not need to know anything about birds, they just need a smartphone, and the BirdNET app can then provide both them and the research team with a prediction for which bird they have heard. This has led to tremendous participation worldwide, which translates to an incredible wealth of data, and it is really a testament to an enthusiasm for birds that unites people from all walks of life, Wood further said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Stefan Kahl, co-author on the paper, said the guiding design principles were that the researchers needed an accurate algorithm and a simple user interface because otherwise, users would not return to the app.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;The study demonstrated that the BirdNET app data successfully replicated the known distribution pattern of song-types among white-throated sparrows, and the seasonal migratory ranges of the brown thrasher.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;The app is available for both iOS and Android devices.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;", "link": "https://news.abplive.com/science/this-new-app-can-identify-more-than-3000-birds-just-by-sound-1539930", "published_js": "2022-06-29", "author": "Radifah Kabir"}, {"title": "Indian Women Found Carrying 109 Wild Animals In Luggage At Bangkok Airport, Arrested", "summary": "&lt;p&gt;In a rare attempt of smuggling, two Indian women were arrested after over 100 wild animals were found in their luggage at the Bangkok airport earlier this week.
