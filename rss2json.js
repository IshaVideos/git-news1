The UK's official weather service provides warnings up to seven days ahead for rain, thunderstorms, wind, snow, lightning, ice, extreme heat and fog. The warnings are given three colours &amp;mdash; yellow, amber or red &amp;mdash; depending on a combination of both the impact the weather may have and the likelihood of those impacts occurring.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Amber warning is used to represent an increased likelihood of impacts from severe weather, which could potentially disrupt one's plans. There is a possibility of road and rail closures, and power cuts, damage to property, travel delays and cancellations, and loss of water supplies, among other risks. Therefore, people must think about changing their plans and taking action to protect themselves and their property.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What Is A UK Heatwave?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;An extended period of hot weather relative to the expected conditions of the area at that time of the year, which may be accompanied by high humidity, is known as a heatwave. A UK heatwave threshold is said to be met when a location records a period of at least three consecutive days with daily maximum temperatures meeting or exceeding the heatwave temperature threshold. The threshold varies depending on the UK county.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;The revised thresholds use the 1991-2020 averaging period introduced in January 2022. The heatwave threshold daily maximum temperature could be 25 degrees Celsius, 26 degrees Celsius, 27 degrees Celsius, or 28 degrees Celsius, depending on the county.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Geographical differences result in climate differences across the UK.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What Is Causing A Heatwave In The UK?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;According to the Met Office, heatwaves are most common in summer when high pressure develops across an area, and can occur in the UK due to the location of the jet stream, which is usually to the north of the UK in the summer.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;The jet stream is a core of strong winds around five to seven miles above the Earth's surface, blowing from west to east, and causes changes in the wind and pressure at that level, affecting things nearer the surface, such as areas of high and low pressure. This helps shape the weather.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Slower jet streams can allow high pressure to develop over the UK, resulting in persistent dry and settled weather.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;A system called the Azores High is responsible for the UK heatwave. The Azores High is a large, persistent atmospheric high-pressure centre that develops over the subtropical region of the eastern North Atlantic Ocean during the winter and spring seasons in the Northern Hemisphere, and moves westward during the summer and fall.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;The Azores High usually sits off Spain, but has grown larger and pushed farther north. This has brought high temperatures to the UK, France and the Iberian Peninsula, an article published by The Guardian said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;The UK has become 0.9 degrees Celsius warmer in the past three decades.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Will It Get Hotter In The UK?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Annie Shuttleworth at the Met Office said that the UK will cool a little in the middle of the week, as cooler air pushes down from the north, according to the article. However, southern England will still have temperatures in the high 20s.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;After this, the jet streams are expected to turn southerly, and this will bring hot air up from north Africa and the Sahara. Shuttleworth said that at the end of the week, temperatures will be close to 40 to 45 degrees Celsius across France and Spain. The UK will tap into some of the heat in the wake of a southerly wind.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;In the month of July, the days are long and nights are short, as a result of which strong sunshine builds up high temperatures. Night-time lows are potentially above 20 degrees Celsius in central England and affect sleep.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;There is a strong chance of the hottest day of the year so far in the UK occurring this week, the article stated. The temperature may surpass the 32.7 degrees Celsius recorded at Heathrow on June 17. The all-time UK record, which is the 38.7 degrees Celsius recorded in Cambridge University Botanic Garden in July 2019, could be beaten.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Is Climate Change Responsible For The UK Heatwave?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;In a UK series from 1884, Summer 2018 was the equal-second warmest summer for mean daily maximum temperature, shared with 1995. Research shows that climate change is making heat waves more likely.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;The Met Office had conducted a scientific study into the Summer 2018 heatwave in the UK, and found that the likelihood of the UK experiencing a summer as hot or hotter than 2018 is a little over one in 10.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Due to the higher concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, it is 30 times more likely for heat waves to occur now than before the industrial revolution, according to the study.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;As greenhouse gas concentrations increase, heatwaves of similar intensity are projected to become even more common and frequent, according to the Met Office. The heatwaves may occur as regularly as every other year by the 2050s. Since the pre-industrial period (1850-1990), the Earth's surface temperature has risen by one degrees Celsius. The UK temperatures have risen by a similar amount.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;According to the Guardian article, human-caused heating is making every heatwave more intense and more likely. Dr Friederiko Otto of Imperial College London said that when it comes to summer heat, climate change is a complete game changer and has already turned what would once have been called &quot;exceptional heat into very frequent summer conditions&quot;. The fossil fuels burnt over the last decades have caused every heatwave experienced today to become hotter than before.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Impact Of The Heat Waves&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Temperatures will soar above 40 degrees Celsius in western continental Europe. According to the article, Europe as a whole experienced its second warmest June on record, at about 1.6 degrees Celsius above average. The extreme temperatures were recorded from Spain to France to Italy.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Heatwaves could be a severe threat to public health because they may cause heatstroke and dehydration, which are the main risks to health, particularly affecting young children and elderly people.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Dr Laurence Wainwright of the University of Oxford said that heatwaves can have a significant impact on mental health, and that there are &quot;positive associations between daily high temperatures and suicide&quot;.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Dr Michael Byrne of the University of St Andrews said that the current heatwave is a dangerous reminder of the accelerating impacts of global warming, and that London is expected to feel like Barcelona by 2050. He also said that the UK is braced for more frequent and severe heat waves over the coming years.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;According to the Met Office, the adverse health effects for those vulnerable to heat include sunburn, heat exhaustion and other heat-related illnesses.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;During a heatwave, failure of heat-sensitive equipment may occur. Loss of electricity, water supplies and gas is also possible.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;There is a likelihood of some disruption to travel. This may result in heavy traffic and queues.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Due to the heatwave, there is also an increased risk of water safety incidents.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;The UK experienced heatwave conditions lasting 10 days in August 2003. The heatwave conditions resulted in 2,000 deaths.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;A record maximum temperature of 38.5 degrees Celsius was recorded at Faversham in Kent in 2003. Similar conditions occurred in July 2006, breaking records and resulting in the warmest month on record in the UK.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;The 2003 maximum temperature record was broken at Cambridge University Botanic Garden in the summer of 2019.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Heatwave Plan&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;The UK Health Security Agency, in association with the Met Office and other partners, has created a heatwave plan to aid in the preparation and awareness before and during a spell of very hot weather.

There had been an increase of almost nine years in global life expectancy since 1990. However, in 2021, global life expectancy at birth fell to 71 years.

Life expectancy in the least developed countries lagged seven years behind the global average in the year 2021. This was largely due to persistently high levels of child and maternal mortality. In some countries, violence and conflict, or the continuing impact of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) epidemic resulted in the life expectancy lagging seven years behind the global average.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;There is a female advantage in life expectancy. As a result, women outnumber men at older ages in almost all populations. According to the report, women comprised 55.7 per cent of persons aged 65 or older in 2022. The percentage of women aged 65 or older is projected to decline slightly to 54.5 per cent by 2050.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Covid-19 Pandemic Has Affected All Components Of Population Change&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Due to the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic, global life expectancy at birth fell to 71 years in 2021, down from 72.8 in 2019. In 2019, there had been an improvement of almost nine years since 1990.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;The impact of the pandemic on life expectancy has varied across regions and countries. For instance, life expectancy at birth in Central and Southern Asia and in Latin America and the Caribbean fell by almost three years between 2019 and 2021.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;By contrast, the combined population of Australia and New Zealand gained 1.2 years due to lower mortality risks during the pandemic for some causes of death, the report says.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;The pandemic has been responsible for a significant reduction in life expectancy at birth in some countries. Estimates of life expectancy at birth declined by more than four years between 2019 and 2022, for countries such as Bolivia, Botswana, Lebanon, Mexico, Oman, and the Russian Federation.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In Some Countries, Progress In Life Expectancy Was Slowing Even Before Covid-19 Pandemic&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;In some countries of Europe and North America, progress in life expectancy was already slowing even before the outbreak of the Covid-19 pandemic. For instance, in Canada, the United Kingdom and the United States, vital statistics point to levels of life expectancy for recent years that are lower than what was previously projected based on the historical trajectory of improvement in survival in each country, the report says.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;The stagnating decline in cardiovascular disease mortality is one of the most important reasons behind the stalling life expectancy in the United States.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Life Expectancy At Birth Reached Close To 85 Years Or Above In Some Countries In 2021&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;In 2021, the disparity between the country with the highest and the country with lowest life expectancy at birth stood at 33.4, according to the report. Life expectancy at birth reached close to 85 years or above in 2021 in certain countries including Australia, the Hong Kong and Macao special administrative regions of China, and Japan.

Life expectancy at birth is projected to reach 77.2 years worldwide by 2050. A gap of 31.8 years is projected to remain between the countries with the lowest and the highest values.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;As countries reach historically low levels of mortality, further reductions in death rates become more difficult to achieve and the rise in life expectancy slows down.

Before the outbreak of the Covid-19 pandemic, in 2019, people who had already survived to age 65, could expect to live on average an additional 17.5 years worldwide, the report says.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;This is 6.2 years longer than a person of the same age in the early 1950s.
