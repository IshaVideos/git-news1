The dispatch of this wheat to Afghanistan has already commenced, he said.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Further, to oversee the utilization of India&amp;rsquo;s medical and food-grain assistance and to further assess the humanitarian requirements of the Afghan people, an Indian team visited Kabul recently on June 2-3 and met with representatives of international organizations involved in the distribution of the humanitarian assistance.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;In addition, the team also visited places where Indian programmes and projects are being implemented like Indira Gandhi Children Hospital, Habibia High School, Chimtala sub-power station and the WFP wheat distribution centre.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;We are now in the process of shipping more medical assistance and food grains to Afghanistan. We also gifted one million doses of India&amp;rsquo;s COVAXIN &lt;a title=&quot;COVID-19&quot; href=&quot;https://news.abplive.com/topic/coronavirus-india&quot; data-type=&quot;interlinkingkeywords&quot;&gt;COVID-19&lt;/a&gt; vaccines to Iran to administer to the Afghan refugees in Iran. In addition, we have assisted UNICEF by supplying almost 60 million doses of polio vaccine and two tons of essential medicines,&amp;rdquo; he said.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Tirumurti reiterated that humanitarian assistance should be based on principles of neutrality, impartiality, and independence. The disbursement of humanitarian aid should be non-discriminatory and accessible to all, irrespective of ethnicity, religion, or political belief. In particular, the assistance should reach the most vulnerable first, including women, children, and minorities.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Noting that peace and security in Afghanistan are critical imperatives that the international community needs to collectively strive for, he said India will continue to play its role in the pursuit of that objective and the interests of the Afghan people will continue to be at the heart of our efforts in Afghanistan.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;He underlined that as a contiguous neighbour and long-standing partner of Afghanistan, India has direct stakes in ensuring the return of peace and stability to the country.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Therefore, given our strong historical and civilisational linkages to the Afghan people, we are deeply concerned about the recent developments in Afghanistan, especially the deteriorating humanitarian situation,&amp;rdquo; he said Tirumurti stressed that India&amp;rsquo;s approach to Afghanistan, as always, will be guided by its historical friendship and special relationship with the people of Afghanistan.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;On the political front, India continues to call for an inclusive dispensation in Afghanistan which represents all sections of the Afghan society. A broad-based, inclusive, and representative formation is necessary for both domestic and international engagement, he added.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;We are deeply concerned about recent developments in Afghanistan which directly impact women and girls of Afghanistan. There has been an increasing attempt towards removing women from public life in Afghanistan. We join others in calling for ensuring the protection of rights of women and girls and to ensure that the long-fought gains of the last two decades are not reversed,&amp;rdquo; he said.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;DISCLAIMER: This report has been published as part of the auto-generated syndicate wire feed.

This is our central estimate, with the uncertainty in this estimate ranging between 36,65,000-43,70,000,&quot; lead author of the study, Oliver Watson from the Imperial College London, the UK, told PTI.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&quot;What this modelling study shows is that the vaccination campaign in India has likely saved millions of lives. This shows the remarkable impact that the vaccination has had, especially in India, which was the first country to experience the impact of the Delta variant,&quot; Watson said in an email.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The India numbers are based on the estimates that 51,60,000 (48,24,000-56,29,000) deaths may have occurred in the country during the pandemic, a number which is 10 times the official figure of 5,24,941 deaths reported so far, he said.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&quot;These estimates are based on the estimates of excess mortality in India during the COVID-19 pandemic, which we have sourced from The Economist and are similar to the estimates that the WHO has reported. Independently, our group has also investigated the COVID-19 death toll based on reports of excess mortality and seroprevalence surveys and arrived at similar estimates of almost 10 times the official count,&quot; Watson said.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;According to the estimates by The Economist, 2.3 million people died in India from COVID-19 by the start of May 2021, as against official figures of around 2,00,000.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The WHO had last month estimated that there were 4.7 million Covid-linked deaths in India, a figure that was refuted by the government.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Of the almost 20 million deaths estimated to have been prevented in the first year after vaccines were introduced, almost 7.5 million deaths were prevented in countries covered by the COVID-19 Vaccine Access initiative (COVAX), the researchers said.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;COVAX was set up because it was clear early on that global vaccine equity would be the only way out of the pandemic, they said.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The initiative has facilitated access to affordable vaccines for lower-income countries to try to reduce inequalities, with an initial target of giving both vaccine doses to 20 per cent of the population in countries covered by the commitment by the end of 2021, the researchers said.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Since the first COVID-19 vaccine was administered outside of a clinical trial setting on December 8, 2020, almost two-thirds of the world's population has received at least one dose of a COVID-19 vaccine (66 per cent), they noted.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Despite the incredible speed of the vaccine roll-out worldwide, more than 3.5 million COVID-19 deaths have been reported since the first vaccine was administered in December 2020, they said.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;To estimate the impact of the global vaccination programmes, the researchers used an established model of COVID-19 transmission using country-level data for officially recorded COVID-19 deaths occurring between December 8, 2020 and December 8 2021.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;To account for the under-reporting of deaths in countries with weaker surveillance systems, they carried out a separate analysis based on the number of excess deaths recorded above those that would have been expected during the same time period.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;China was not included in the analysis owing to its large population and very strict lockdown measures which would have skewed the findings, the researchers said.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The team found that based on officially recorded COVID-19 deaths, an estimated 18.1 million deaths would have occurred during the study period if vaccinations had not been implemented.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Of these, the model estimates that vaccination has prevented 14.4 million deaths, representing a global reduction of 79 per cent.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;These findings do not account for the under-reporting of COVID-19 deaths, which is common in lower-income countries.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The team did a further analysis based on total excess deaths during the same time period to account for this.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;They found that COVID-19 vaccination prevented an estimated 19.8 million deaths out of a total of 31.4 million potential deaths that would have occurred without vaccination, a reduction of 63 per cent.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;More than three quarters (79 per cent) of deaths averted were due to the direct protection against severe symptoms provided by the vaccination, leading to lower mortality rates, the researchers said.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The remaining 4.3 million averted deaths were estimated to have been prevented by indirect protection from reduced transmission of the virus in the population and reduced burden on healthcare systems, thereby improving access to medical care for those most in need, they said.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The study found that the vaccine impact changed over time and in different areas of the world as the pandemic progressed.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;In the first half of 2021, the greatest number of deaths averted by vaccination was seen in lower middle-income countries, resulting from the significant epidemic wave in India as the Delta variant emerged.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;This subsequently shifted to the greatest impact being concentrated in higher-income countries in the second half of 2021, as restrictions on travel and social mixing were eased in some areas leading to greater virus transmission.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The shortfall in the WHO target of fully vaccinating 40 per cent of the population of each country by the end of 2021 is estimated to have contributed to an additional 5,99,300 deaths worldwide that could have been prevented.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Lower-middle-income countries accounted for the majority of these deaths.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&quot;Our study demonstrates the enormous benefit that vaccines had in reducing deaths from COVID-19 globally,&quot; said Professor Azra Ghani, Chair in Infectious Disease Epidemiology at Imperial College London.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&quot;Whilst the intense focus on the pandemic has now shifted, it is important that we ensure the most vulnerable people in all parts of the world are protected from the ongoing circulation of COVID-19 and from the other major diseases that continue to disproportionately affect the poorest,&quot; Ghani said.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The authors note several limitations to their findings.

The girl, 12, had been suffering from a rare but severe spinal deformity since she was seven years of age, as a result of which her back began to bend side-to-side from the normal spinal curve, a statement released by the hospital said. Her parents were the first to notice her condition, and decided to seek medical help. The girl's spinal curve kept growing and became very pronounced in the last two years.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Girl Was Suffering From Juvenile Idiopathic Scoliosis&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;In the statement, Dr Tomar said that the girl was diagnosed with Juvenile Idiopathic Scoliosis, a rare condition that can become life-threatening with lack of treatment. He explained that a patient suffering from this condition has an abnormal curvature of the spine, which causes the spinal column to bend left or right, in the shape of an S.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Curve Beyond 60 Degrees Becomes Progressive For Life&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Dr Tomar added that a curve of up to 10 degrees in a human spine is considered normal. However, a spinal curve beyond 60 degrees becomes progressive for life. This is because it will keep becoming more and more severe with time. He said the condition is present in about 0.5 per cent of the total population of children.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Girl Had A Spinal Curve Of 120 Degrees&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;When the girl visited the hospital, she already had a spinal curve of 120 degrees. The curve had progressed quickly by 40 degrees during the previous year, the statement said.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;The total volume of air that her lungs could hold had decreased, as she was suffering from a restrictive pulmonary disease. Dr Tomar said that the child's spine would have kept growing till she turned 18, and that the curve would have become more severe. He added that her lungs would have continued getting compressed, and that she would not have been able to breathe enough air. According to him, any delay in the treatment would have been life-threatening for her.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Girl Was Kept In Spinal Traction For A Week Before Surgery&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;There was also a risk of the girl getting paralysed from direct correction of such a massive spinal curve as hers. Therefore, she was kept in spinal traction for a week to loosen her tissues around the spine. As a result, the curvature of the spine was reduced to 80 degrees from 120 degrees. After this, the doctors operated on her.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How Was The Surgery Conducted?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Dr Tomar said the surgery was extremely difficult as fixing screws through the twisted, small bones of the spine was a very challenging task. He explained that the C-arm X-ray machine used routinely to guide the doctors during the surgery was of no use due to the massive deformity in her spine.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Dr Tomar said the pedicle bones that form the bridge between the vertebrae had become hard. Therefore, the hand manoeuvres were difficult. Despite all this, the surgery was a complete success, Dr Tomar said. The doctors managed to correct the spine deformity by as much as 75 per cent and the girl was able to walk on her own feet the very next day. He further said that the spinal curve was reduced to just 46 degrees from 120 degrees, curing the patient completely. Four days after her surgery, she was discharged.

Kinza, a 23-year-old transgender, was waiting for an auto rickshaw by the side of a road in Race Course area of the city on Wednesday when she was attacked by Hamza Salim, police said. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Hamza appeared on a motorbike there and threw acid on her before fleeing the scene, news agency PTI reported. Police claimed to have arrested the suspect and registered a case against him and three other accomplices.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Kinza was taken to the Services Hospital immediately, where she received treatment for her arm and face burns. It was reported that her condition was stable.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Kinza's friend Hina told reporters at the hospital that Hamza wanted to develop relations with her, to which she refused.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;On her refusal, the suspect turned hostile and threatened to kill her. Hina also alleged that Hamza was the leader of a gang that intimidated transgender people in the city and requested CM of Punjab to provide security to Kinza.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Ataullah Tarar, the interior minister, met Kinza at the hospital and praised the police for the quick action. He asserted that there was zero tolerance for such acts, PTI reported.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Approximately 77% of transgenders in Pakistan have reported physical attacks, according to a recent study. The study says the transgender community is socially excluded by the Pakistani society. The transgenders experience high levels of physical abuse and face discriminatory behaviour in daily life.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&quot;Such attitudes make them vulnerable for risky behaviors, such as compelling them to become commercial sex workers, begging, drug use, and even suicidal ideation,&quot; it says.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;In October 2021, a transgender woman died in another instance of acid attack.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Under Section 144 of the Pakistan Penal Code, public dealing of acid and other corrosive substances is banned. Offenders are punishable under Section 336(B) of the Pakistan Penal Code, which has a maximum term of life imprisonment.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The National Assembly passed the Acid and Burn Crime Bill in 2018, which seeks to specifically criminalise acid and burn-related violence by ensuring a fair and expeditious trial for such heinous crimes as well as for matters related to and incidental to them.&lt;/p&gt;", "link": "https://news.abplive.com/news/world/pakistan-acid-thrown-on-23-year-old-transgender-in-lahore-suspect-arrested-1538862", "published_js": "2022-06-23", "author": "ABP News Bureau"}, {"title": "First Monkeypox Case Confirmed In South Africa, Patient Had No Travel History: Report", "summary": "&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Monkeypox Cases Worldwide:&lt;/strong&gt; The first monkeypox case has been confirmed in South Africa, health minister Joe Phaahla announced. At a press conference on Thursday, Phaahla stated that the patient was a 30-year-old male from Johannesburg who had no travel history, news agency Reuters reported.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Phaahla told the press that this confirmed case of monkeypox &quot;cannot be attributed to having been acquired outside South Africa&quot; hence a process of contact tracing was underway.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The World Health Organization (WHO) will decide on Thursday whether to declare monkeypox a global health emergency, prompting criticism from prominent African scientists who claim it has been a crisis in their region for years. The highest level of alert given by WHO is a &quot;public health emergency of international concern&quot; which it had declared with the spread of Covid-19.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;In contrast to the coronavirus when it first emerged, monkeypox is not nearly as contagious as Covid, and vaccines and treatments are readily available. From the current outbreak outside of Africa, the case count has topped 3,000 in more than 40 countries, according to Reuters. It is endemic in parts of Africa, often in proximity to the tropical rainforests but not in South Africa.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Monkeypox is a viral disease that causes flu-like symptoms and skin lesions. While clinically less severe than smallpox, monkeypox is a viral zoonosis (a virus that spreads from animals to people) with symptoms that were once common among smallpox patients. Numerous rodent species and non-human primates serve as animal hosts. The central African (Congo Basin) clade and the West African clade are two distinct genetic clades of the monkeypox virus.&lt;/p&gt;", "link": "https://news.abplive.com/news/world/monkeypox-virus-case-confirmed-in-south-africa-first-patient-had-no-travel-history-report-1538843", "published_js": "2022-06-23", "author": "ABP News Bureau"}]}, "swarajyamag.com": {"feed": {"title": "swarajyamag.com"}, "entries": [{"title": "From Leaders Switching Sides 'For The Sake Of Secularism', To A State Government On Verge Of Collapse For 'Not Being Hindutva Enough' -
