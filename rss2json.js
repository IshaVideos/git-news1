Malik and co-accused Ajaib Singh Bagri were acquitted in 2005 of mass murder and conspiracy charges related to the two bombings in 1985 that killed 331 people.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Homicide investigators are now trying to figure out who killed the controversial community leader, one-time terror suspect, a wealthy businessman and founder of both the Khalsa Credit Union and Khalsa Schools.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The Integrated Homicide Investigation Team (IHIT) released an eerie video Friday of a white Honda CRV driving through the parking area of the complex where Papillon Eastern Imports, which Malik founded as a Gastown store in the early 1970s, is based, Toronto Sun newspaper reported.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;There appears to be more than one person inside, it said.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The IHIT&amp;rsquo;s Sergeant David Lee said the Compact Recreational Vehicle (CRV), which was later found burning at 122A Street and 82nd Avenue, was linked to Malik&amp;rsquo;s targeted slaying.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;A review of CCTV determined that this CRV arrived...a short time before the shooting and waited for Mr Malik,&amp;rdquo; Lee said.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Anyone nearby who witnessed anything or has dash-cam footage taken between 7 am and 9 am is asked to contact investigators, he said.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Police have not yet determined a motive in the case and Lee urged the public not to jump to conclusions, saying IHIT has &amp;ldquo;a number of investigative avenues available to us.&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;We understand this is a high-profile international story.
