In situations of conflict and emergencies and humanitarian crises, they are particularly vulnerable, both in terms of their safety and also in terms of their being able to look after their families and feed their families,&quot; she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Observing that women play essential roles at the household and community levels, she told lawmakers that they are the front-line caretakers and mothers of children. They are the providers and processors and producers of food, and they are income earners, and they are leaders within their communities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Yet, they face disadvantages in being able to access productive resources such as employment, education, income, land, etc. That puts them at a disadvantage to fully play their roles,&quot; she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;So, by disadvantaging them in that way, you are holding them back, but you're also holding back their families, their households, their communities, and the economies of entire nations. So, in fact, a McKinsey report recently identified that in 2015, the cost to the global GDP is about USD28 trillion over a 10-year period if those inequality indicators were not improved, if the gap was not closed. So, it has economic consequences, as well as it's a rights issue,&quot; Gupta said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Describing herself as a first-generation immigrant, she said: &quot;I belong to a family of professional women, each of whom dedicated their lives to serving their communities and from a family of men who supported them fully.&quot; \tShe told lawmakers that she did her doctoral research in India on understanding the barriers that women face in pursuing a career, which ultimately, propelled her toward a career focused on rectifying the inequities experienced by women. &quot;That became both my passion and my profession,&quot; Gupta said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;From the women entrepreneurs in Kenya and India who sustain small businesses despite limited access to financial services, to the brave women in Liberia who mobilised against great odds to demand peace for their families and communities, I have seen women use the limited resources they have to provide for their families and protect others,&quot; she added.

My relationship with (India is) very good&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Biden's remarks came a day after State Department spokesperson Ned Price said the US is there for India and reiterated that New Delhi's relationship with Moscow developed over several decades when Washington was &quot;not prepared or able to be a partner of choice&quot; for the Indian government.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Price was responding to a question on whether the US was talking with the Indian authorities as India and other Asian nations are becoming an increasingly vital source of oil revenues for sanctions-hit Russia, despite strong pressure from America.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&quot;We have had a number of discussions with our Indian partners, and the point that we have made is that every country is going to have a different relationship with Moscow,&quot; Price told reporters at his daily news conference on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Russia has overtaken Saudi Arabia to become India's second-biggest supplier of oil behind Iraq as refiners snap up Russian crude available at a deep discount following the war in Ukraine, industry data showed recently.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;India, the world's third-biggest oil-importing and consuming nation, has long defended purchases of crude oil from Russia following President Vladimir Putin ordering the invasion of Ukraine. The oil ministry had last month stated that &quot;energy purchases from Russia remain minuscule in comparison to India's total consumption.&quot; Price said India's relationship with Russia developed over several decades.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&quot;It developed over the course of decades at a time when the United States was not prepared or able to be a partner of choice for the Indian government,&quot; he said.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&quot;That has changed. This is a legacy of a bipartisan tradition now that has been the case for more than two decades. It goes back really to the Clinton administration, certainly to the George W Bush administration, where the United States has sought a partnership with India, has sought to be a partner of choice for India, including when it comes to the security realm,&quot; he said.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;This is not a partnership built in the course of days, weeks, or months, Price said.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&quot;I mentioned before that India's relationship with Russia was built up over the course of many decades, as countries reorient their relationship with Moscow, as we have seen many of them do. This will be a gradual process,&quot; he said in response to a question.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&quot;But throughout it all, we have made clear to our Indian partners that we are there for them. We are ready and able, and willing to partner with them. And we've done just that,&quot; Price said.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&quot;Of course, we had a '2+2' dialogue with our Indian partners not too long ago. We will see Prime Minister Narendra Modi once again in the context of the I2U2, the arrangement we have with the UAE and Israel, along with India, incorporating India into many of the partnerships we have, including, of course, the Quad,&quot; he said.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&quot;And that is a group this administration has sought to revitalise, and it has done so at very high levels,&quot; the official added.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;To re-energise and revitalise American alliances globally, the US, UAE, India and Israel have formed a new grouping called I2-U2. The four countries in the new grouping will hold their first virtual summit next month.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Quad comprises Japan, India, Australia and the United States.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The four countries in 2017 had given shape to the Quadrilateral coalition to counter China's aggressive behaviour in the Indo-Pacific region.&lt;/p&gt;", "link": "https://news.abplive.com/news/world/us-president-joe-biden-says-his-relationship-with-india-is-very-good-1537899", "published_js": "2022-06-17", "author": "PTI"}]}}};
