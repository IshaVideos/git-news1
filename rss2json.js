The scientists also advocated renaming the monkeypox virus with numbers.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Tulio de Oliveira, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Director of the Centre for Epidemic Response and Innovation (CERI), South Africa, wrote in a tweet: &amp;ldquo;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;We propose a novel non-discriminatory &amp;amp; non-stigmatizing classification of monkeypox aligned with best practices in the naming infectious diseases to minimize negative impacts on nations, economies &amp;amp; people and consider the evolution &amp;amp; spread of the virus&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;The scientists suggested in the paper that the virus should be broadly classified as &quot;hMPXV&quot;.

During the beginning of the Covid-19 pandemic, people around the world referred to the novel coronavirus as China virus or Wuhan virus. Then, the emergence of a Covid strain in South Africa led to travel bans. This prompted the WHO to rename the virus as SARS-CoV-2.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Incidence Of Monkeypox Cases Worldwide&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;As many as 2,821 people in both endemic and non-endemic countries have been infected with the monkeypox virus so far.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;The WHO reported 1,285 monkeypox cases in 28 'non-endemic' countries, particularly in Europe, North America, and Australia, as of June 8.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;As many as 1,536 suspected cases and 59 confirmed cases have been reported in about eight African countries, including Cameroon, Central African Republic, Congo and Liberia, where monkeypox is endemic&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;The non-endemic countries have not reported any deaths from monkeypox to date.

However, some individuals can suffer from severe illness.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Though there is a very low risk of transmission to the general population, monkeypox can be spread when someone is in close contact with an infected person.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;The monkeypox virus belongs to the Orthopoxvirus genus in the family Poxviridae, and was first discovered in 1958 when two outbreaks of a pox-like disease occurred in colonies of monkeys kept for research.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p class=&quot;article-title &quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a title=&quot;Know All About The Monkeypox&quot; href=&quot;https://news.abplive.com/science/monkeypox-virus-case-confirmed-in-uk-know-what-is-monkeypox-all-you-need-to-know-1530624&quot; target=&quot;&quot;&gt;What Is Monkeypox?

Pancreatic beta cells are endocrine cells which synthesise, store, and release insulin. Chimeric antigen-receptor T cells are the T cells which have been genetically engineered to produce T cell receptors for use in immunotherapy. These cells are used for the treatment of certain kinds of blood cancers.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;The team of researchers has demonstrated the feasibility of this approach to treat type 1 diabetes, according to data presented on Monday, June 13, at ENDO 2022, the annual meeting of the Endocrine Society in Atlanta, Georgia. The Endocrine Society is a medical organisation in the field of endocrinology and metabolism.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;The study was led by Juan Carlos Jaume, Director of the Center for Diabetes and Endocrine Research (CeDER), at the University of Toledo in Toledo, Ohio.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What Are Adoptive Cell Transfer Therapies And How Can They Be Used To Treat Type 1 Diabetes?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Adoptive cell transfer therapies with chimeric antigen-receptor regulatory T cells have been found to be effective for the treatment of haematological malignancies.&amp;nbsp; Adoptive cell transfer is the transfer of cells into a patient, which may have originated from the patient or from another individual. Chimeric antigen receptor regulatory T cells are antigen-specific immunosuppressive cells that help prevent undesired immune responses. Engineered T cell receptors called chimeric antigen receptors allow direct recognition of a target antigen without requiring antigen presentation. This is a process in the body's immune system by which different cells capture antigens, and then present them to naive T cells, which enable the body to fight off new, unrecognised infections and diseases. Haematologic malignancies are cancers that begin in blood-forming tissue such as bone marrow, or in the cells of the immune system. These cancers can be treated with the help of adoptive cell transfer therapies.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How Can Genetically Engineered T Cells Cure Type 1 Diabetes?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;The researchers attempted to replicate an equally effective experimental treatment for type 1 diabetes using non-cytotoxic, anti-inflammatory regulatory T-cells. Regulatory T cells are T cells which have a role in regulating or suppressing other cells in the immune system, and help prevent autoimmune disease. Non-cytotoxic regulatory T cells do not directly kill other cells.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;According to a statement released by the Endocrine Society, the researchers drew blood one to two weeks prior to pancreatic surgery. The pancreas was removed for a clinically indicated reason such as cancer or pancreatitis. After this, they collected a small piece of the pancreas.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;The researchers isolated regulatory T cells from the blood samples and expanded them in vitro. They genetically modified the cells to express a beta-cell, target-specific chimeric antigen-receptor combined with a green fluorescence protein (GFP) marker.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Then, the researchers processed the pancreas tissue for islet separation. Islets of Langerhans are a group of pancreatic cells which secrete insulin.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;The researchers co-cultured the human pancreatic islets combined with the beta-cell, target-specific chimeric antigen-receptor regulatory T cells.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;It was observed that within 24 hours, the GFP positive, chimeric antigen-receptor regulatory T cells successfully migrated onto the pancreatic islets. The chimeric antigen-receptor regulatory T cells significantly proliferated when they were in physical contact with the pancreatic islets in the subsequent 72 hours.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;In the statement, Jaume said that the study is the first successful, pancreatic beta-cell, target specific chimeric antigen-receptor-regulatory T cell treatment of type 1 diabetes in a humanised mouse model which closely resembles the human disease. He added that based on their mice and human in-vitro data, the researchers believe treatment with these cells will for recovery and reconstitution of beta cells in human type 1 diabetes patients as well.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;The immune system of a person with type 1 diabetes attacks and destroys the cells in the pancreas that make insulin, as a result of which the organ stops making the hormone. The genetically engineered beta cell, target-specific T cells can prevent undesired immune responses, thereby serving as a treatment for type 1 diabetes. Thus, the therapy helps restore the pancreatic beta cells.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p class=&quot;article-title &quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a title=&quot;EXPLAINED | What ICMR Guidelines Say About Management Of Type 1 Diabetes&quot; href=&quot;https://news.abplive.com/health/icmr-guidelines-say-about-management-of-type-1-diabetes-know-in-details-explained-1537303&quot; target=&quot;&quot;&gt;EXPLAINED | What ICMR Guidelines Say About Management Of Type 1 Diabetes&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;", "link": "https://news.abplive.com/science/this-new-therapy-can-treat-type-1-diabetes-by-restoring-insulin-producing-pancreatic-cells-study-1537454", "published_js": "2022-06-15", "author": "Radifah Kabir"}, {"title": "194 Years After Ex-Slave Sojourner Truth\u2019s Historic Win, Original Court Documents On Public Display For First Time", "summary": "&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;In 1828, Isabella Van Wagenen, a Black woman in the United States who had escaped slavery with her infant daughter, won a historic court battle to bring her enslaved minor son, Peter, home from Alabama.

While she took along her infant daughter, her minor son Peter was left behind.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Isabella then started to work for the family of Isaac Van Wagener, who &amp;ldquo;set her free&amp;rdquo; as New York state abolished slavery in 1827, according to Encyclopedia Britannica. She took the surname.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;In the mean time, however, Peter had reached Alabama, sold into slavery. Had he been in New York, Peter would have been an indentured servant until he was older. The indentured system of bonded labour was instituted after the abolition of slavery. But Peter had been sold to another state, and it was illegal, according to the AP report.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;With the help of two lawyers who allied with her, Isabella went to court in Kingston to get her son back, the AP report said, quoting Nell Irvin Painter, author of &amp;lsquo;Sojourner Truth: A Life, A Symbol&amp;rsquo;.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;On March 15, 1828, a Supreme Court commissioner ordered Peter to be freed, and the mother and son were finally reunited.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;The reunion, however, came with its own share of sufferings. According to the AP report, Peter was a traumatised child, and his body bore marks of beatings. It took him some time to accept Isabella as his mother, who was supporting herself and the two children through domestic employment in New York City.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;&amp;ldquo;He ended up, as many troubled young men did at that time, on a Nantucket whaling vessel, and he was finally lost at sea,&amp;rdquo; Painter was quoted as saying.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Isabella meanwhile joined missionary Elijah Pierson and his Retrenchment Society, working and preaching in the streets, the report added.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;In 1843, she took the name Sojourner Truth.

They were transferred to the Court of Appeals founded in 1847 after a reorganisation of the state court system.

It startled him as this was unusual for the time. A certain &amp;lsquo;Isabella Van Wagenen&amp;rsquo; trying to get son released from slavery rang a bell because it was was then &amp;ldquo;the name of the person who became known as Sojourner Truth&amp;rdquo;, Folts was quoted as saying in a recent interview at the archives.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;&amp;ldquo;We always wondered, &amp;lsquo;Where were these records?&amp;rsquo;&amp;rdquo; Paul O&amp;rsquo;Neill, Ulster County&amp;rsquo;s commissioner of jurors, told AP.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;According to the report, the papers including Isabella&amp;rsquo;s testimony were written in the way court documents read &amp;mdash; full of law jargons.

B cells move into the blood and lymphatic system when they mature. From there, they move to different parts of the body.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What Makes The Treatment Special?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;In a statement released by Tel Aviv University, Dr Barzel explained that until now, only a few scientists, and the study team among them, had been able to engineer B Cells outside the body. He added that in the study, the researchers were the first to do this in the body and to make the cells generate desired antibodies.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Dr Barzel explained that the genetic engineering is done with viral carriers derived from viruses that were engineered so as to not cause damage but only to bring the gene coded for the antibody into the B cells in the body. Additionally, the researchers have been able to accurately introduce the antibodies into a desired site in the B cell genome, he said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Also, all model animals who had been administered the treatment responded and had high quantities of the desired antibody in their blood. The researchers produced the antibody from the blood and made sure it was actually effective in neutralising HIV in the lab dish, Dr Barzel said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How Was The Gene Editing Done?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;According to the study, the genetic editing was done using CRISPR (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats), a technology based on a bacterial immune system against viruses. Emmanuelle Charpentier and Jennifer Doudna were the two biochemists who had figured out the sophisticated defence mechanism.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Since the discovery of the mechanism, CRISPR has been used to either disable unwanted genes or repair and insert desired genes. Doudna and Charpentier were awarded the 2020 Nobel Prize in Chemistry &quot;for the development of a method for genome editing&quot;.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How Did CRISPR Help Deliver Desired Genes To Desired Cells?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Alessio Nehmad, a researcher involved in the new study, said one incorporates the capability of a CRISPR to direct the introduction of genes into desired sites along with the capabilities of viral carriers to bring desired genes to desired cells. Therefore, the researchers were able to engineer the B cells inside the patient's body. They used two viral carriers of the Adeno-Associated Virus (AAV) family. AAV is a versatile viral vector technology that can be engineered for very specific functionality in gene therapy applications, and can be used in a wide range of applications in multiple diseases due to its unique biological and biophysical properties.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;One viral carrier used in the study codes for the desired antibody, and the second carrier codes for the CRISPR system. Nehmad said that when the CRISPR cuts in the desired site in the genome of the B cells, it directs the introduction of the desired gene. This is the gene coding for the antibody against HIV, which causes AIDS.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What Happens When Engineer B Cells Encounter HIV?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;According to the researchers, there is no genetic treatment for AIDS. Therefore, the research opportunities are vast. Dr Barzel concluded that the team developed an innovative treatment which may defeat the virus with a one-time injection, with the potential of bringing about tremendous improvement in the patients' condition. He added that when the engineered B cells encounter the virus, it stimulates and encourages the B cells to divide. Therefore, the scientists are utilising the very cause of the disease to combat it.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;He explained that if the virus changes, the B cells will also change accordingly in order to combat it. In this way, the scientists have created the first medication ever that can evolve in the body and defeat viruses in the 'arms race', he said.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Dr Barzel added that based on the study, the team can expect that over the coming years, it will be able to produce in this way a medication for AIDS, for additional infectious diseases and for certain types of cancer caused by a virus, such as cervical cancer, head and neck cancer and more.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;", "link": "https://news.abplive.com/science/aids-vaccine-could-be-used-to-treat-hiv-new-study-suggests-know-complete-details-1537329", "published_js": "2022-06-14", "author": "Radifah Kabir"}, {"title": "Who is Arati Prabhakar?
