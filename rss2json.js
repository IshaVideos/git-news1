He began making enquiries into gardens in Bolivia to confirm his suspicions.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Bolivian institutions Santa Cruz de La Sierra Botanic Garden and La Rinconada Gardens donated a collection of giant waterlily seeds from the suspected third species, in the year 2016. Carlos, who germinated and grew the seeds at Kew, watched the waterlily grow side-by-side with the other two &lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Victoria&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt; species, and concluded that something was different. He visited Bolivia in the year 2019 to check out the waterlily in the wild.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Carlos said he has learnt a lot in the process of officially naming this new species and it has been the &quot;biggest achievement&quot; of his 20-year career at Kew.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Researcher Made Nocturnal Observations Of Giant Waterlilies&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Lucy Smith was working on a project to make contemporary scientific illustrations of &lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Victoria amazonica&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt; and &lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Victoria cruziana&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;. This is a task which was last attempted by Kew artist Walter Hood Fitch in the 19th century.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;The flowers of giant waterlilies appear only at night. Therefore, Lucy made several nocturnal vigils to the glasshouses to capture the flowers for drawing and painting.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;The first flowers of &lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Victoria boliviana&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt; opened on a stormy evening in July 2018. This is when Lucy shared Carlos's suspicion that the waterlily was unique. She decided to describe the differences using illustrations, and observed a similarity between the new plant and the one which Fitch drew from a specimen collected in Bolivia in 1845. This proved that both the plants are the same species. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Victoria boliviana&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt; was unknown as a new species to Flitch in 1847.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bolivian Specimen Of &lt;em&gt;Victoria boliviana&lt;/em&gt; Was Collected In 1988 &amp;ndash; But Was Not Known As A New Species&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Dr Stephan G Beck, a researcher of the National Herbarium of Bolivia, partnered with the Kew team to formally describe the new species, and collected the type specimen for the waterlily unknowingly in 1988, thinking it was &lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Victoria cruziana&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;. According to the Royal Botanic Gardens, Beck's specimen has a higher value than the 1845 Fitch specimen because it provides better knowledge about the species.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Victoria boliviana&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt; can now be seen in the Waterlily House and the Princess of Wales Conservatory at Kew Gardens, the only place in the world where one can see the three described species of &lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Victoria&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt; together.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;DNA analysis revealed that &lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Victoria boliviana&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt; was genetically very different from the other two species, and diverged from &lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Victoria cruziana&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt; around a million years ago.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;The Kew Waterlily House was originally built to house the &quot;natural wonder&quot; of the Victorian age, the giant waterlily &lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Victoria amazonica&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;.
