It&#8217;s also a developer conference, so those building on and for Apple, get their eyes on the latest and greatest. But there&#8217;s a more low-key announcement I want to see from Apple this year: iTunes being terminated. Put it out to pasture, it&#8217;s done. Nobody would miss it.</p>\n<p>This idea first resonated in my mind upon reading a piece by a former colleague, <a href=\"https://www.techradar.com/uk/news/apple-punishes-windows-11-users-with-new-itunes-update-just-in-time-for-wwdc\"><em>Daryl Baxter</em> over at <em>TechRadar</em></a>. Windows is the last bastion of iTunes and as Baxter&#8217;s headline reads, it&#8217;s almost like a punishment. I have never conversed with a single person who has ever enjoyed using iTunes either on Windows or Mac. I&#8217;ve been using it for about 19 years and it&#8217;s never been fun. So it&#8217;s time to go.</p>\n<h2>iTunes never got better</h2>\n<p><img alt=\"iTunes for Windows\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-651651\" height=\"579\" src=\"https://www.xda-developers.com/files/2022/06/itunes-windows-1-1024x659.jpg\" width=\"900\" /></p>\n<p>The &#8216;modern&#8217; iTunes for Windows has hardly moved along from the earliest incarnations. At first, it was a necessary evil. If you wanted to use an iPod and you had a Windows PC, you had to use iTunes. It was entirely required to transfer your digital music to your digital music player.</p>\n<p>Even in the early days of the iPhone, iTunes had a place. It was clunky to use but for transferring to and from your shiny new Apple phone, it was something you lived with.</p>\n<p>But those days are far behind us. Apple has just <a href=\"https://www.xda-developers.com/20-years-of-ipod/\">discontinued the iPod</a> and who connects their iPhone or iPad to a computer to transfer files anymore? The truth is that even Apple doesn&#8217;t see a reason to use iTunes anymore, after all, it was pulled from the Mac a few years ago. But Windows users are left to suffer, with a product that sees updates but never actually improves.</p>\n<p>Its sole purpose nowadays is as a front-end to Apple Music, your previously purchased music and video library, and the iTunes Store. Everything you do on your iPhone and iPad is wireless. If iTunes for Windows provided access to Apple TV+, there might be an argument to keep it. But it doesn&#8217;t, so there isn&#8217;t. And again, Apple discontinued it on its own desktop platform three years ago. If there were reason to keep it, that wouldn&#8217;t have happened, would it?</p>\n<p>On the Mac, you have Music, Podcasts and Apple TV+. All of these apps are better than the clunky mess that is iTunes for Windows. If Apple has enough paying customers for its music service on Windows that it cares enough to keep iTunes alive, then give us the better apps.</p>\n<h2>Third-party devs doing what Apple can&#8217;t, or won&#8217;t</h2>\n<p><img alt=\"Cider for Apple Music on Windows 11\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-651643\" height=\"562\" src=\"https://www.xda-developers.com/files/2022/06/cider-windows-apple-music-1-1024x639.jpg\" width=\"900\" /></p>\n<p>Apple Music is available as a web app, and it&#8217;s decent enough. But it doesn&#8217;t have offline music. There is also a far superior third-party app called <a href=\"https://github.com/ciderapp/Cider\">Cider</a>. And right now this is the only way anyone should use Apple Music on Windows, albeit, again, without offline music. If you need to be offline, you have to use iTunes.</p>\n<p>Cider, though, is magnificent, even in its early days. It&#8217;s a free, open-source application with a UI reminiscent of the Apple Music web app. But it goes much further, with a whole raft of settings and customizations. I&#8217;ve got a Dracula theme running on mine. It&#8217;s not just visuals, either, there are features to tweak audio, apply lyrics, link to Discord even some experimental plugins. It even has podcasts.</p>\n<p>There&#8217;s still plenty to be done and some features, such as sync, are labeled as a work in progress. But it&#8217;s hosted on Github and has a beta or stable channel you can follow.</p>\n<p>Cider isn&#8217;t just available on Windows, but it does at least serve as a worthwhile alternative to having iTunes in your life. Made better by the fact that it&#8217;s a <strong>really\u00a0</strong>good app. Check it out either on Github, the <a href=\"https://apps.microsoft.com/store/detail/cider-alpha/9P21XJ9D9G66\">Microsoft Store</a>, or install it through the <a href=\"https://winstall.app/apps/CiderCollective.Cider\">Windows Package Manager</a>.</p>\n<h2>Only one thing that needs to happen</h2>\n<p><img alt=\"Apple Music app on Mac\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-651663\" height=\"526\" src=\"https://www.xda-developers.com/files/2022/06/apple-music-app-mac-1024x599.jpg\" width=\"900\" /></p>\n<p>Nobody is surprised Apple prioritizes its own platforms. But nobody is going to be so fed up with iTunes that they&#8217;d run out and buy a Mac. Services like music, podcasts, and TV need to be platform agnostic. Windows just has the numbers. Would the iPod have taken off like it did if it had remained a Mac-only product? Definitely not.</p>\n<p>Apple has been pretty generous with supporting other platforms with its media services. Apple Music is on Android and the <a href=\"https://www.xda-developers.com/best-smart-speakers/\">major smart speakers</a> and Apple TV is available on games consoles and competing smart TV platforms. The precedence for the guardians of iTunes to be a bit more generous to its customers who don&#8217;t drown themselves entirely in Apple hardware is there. By all accounts, the Mac apps are pretty nice to use. Sure would be nice to have them on Windows.</p>\n<p>So please, Apple, finally do the decent thing.

If it doesn&#8217;t, simply navigate to the directory when you installed Minimal ADB Fastboot and double-click on the file labeled\u00a0<em>cmd-here.</em></p>\n<p>Before you proceed any further, you need to enable the <em>ADB debugging\u00a0</em>and\u00a0<em>Debug over Wi-Fi</em> settings on your Watch. To enable these options, you&#8217;ll first have to turn on Developer Options. To do so, head over to the device settings on your watch, scroll all the way down to the <em>About watch</em> option, and tap on it.</p>\n\n<a href=\"https://www.xda-developers.com/files/2022/06/Enable-ECG-and-blood-pressure-monitoring-on-Galaxy-Watch-4-watch-screenshots-2.jpg\"><img alt=\"Galaxy Watch 4 quick settings\" class=\"attachment-large size-large\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://www.xda-developers.com/files/2022/06/Enable-ECG-and-blood-pressure-monitoring-on-Galaxy-Watch-4-watch-screenshots-2.jpg\" width=\"800\" /></a>\n<a href=\"https://www.xda-developers.com/files/2022/06/Enable-ECG-and-blood-pressure-monitoring-on-Galaxy-Watch-4-watch-screenshots-3.jpg\"><img alt=\"About watch option in Galaxy Watch 4 device settings\" class=\"attachment-large size-large\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://www.xda-developers.com/files/2022/06/Enable-ECG-and-blood-pressure-monitoring-on-Galaxy-Watch-4-watch-screenshots-3.jpg\" width=\"800\" /></a>\n<a href=\"https://www.xda-developers.com/files/2022/06/Enable-ECG-and-blood-pressure-monitoring-on-Galaxy-Watch-4-watch-screenshots-4.jpg\"><img alt=\"About watch section in Galaxy Watch 4 settings\" class=\"attachment-large size-large\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://www.xda-developers.com/files/2022/06/Enable-ECG-and-blood-pressure-monitoring-on-Galaxy-Watch-4-watch-screenshots-4.jpg\" width=\"800\" /></a>\n\n<p>On the following page, select the\u00a0<em>Software\u00a0</em>option and then tap on the\u00a0<em>Software version\u00a0</em>on the following page a few times to enable the Developer mode.</p>\n\n<a href=\"https://www.xda-developers.com/files/2022/06/Enable-ECG-and-blood-pressure-monitoring-on-Galaxy-Watch-4-watch-screenshots-5.jpg\"><img alt=\"Software option in About watch page on Galaxy Watch 4\" class=\"attachment-large size-large\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://www.xda-developers.com/files/2022/06/Enable-ECG-and-blood-pressure-monitoring-on-Galaxy-Watch-4-watch-screenshots-5.jpg\" width=\"800\" /></a>\n<a href=\"https://www.xda-developers.com/files/2022/06/Enable-ECG-and-blood-pressure-monitoring-on-Galaxy-Watch-4-watch-screenshots-6.jpg\"><img alt=\"Galaxy Watch 4 software information\" class=\"attachment-large size-large\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://www.xda-developers.com/files/2022/06/Enable-ECG-and-blood-pressure-monitoring-on-Galaxy-Watch-4-watch-screenshots-6.jpg\" width=\"800\" /></a>\n<a href=\"https://www.xda-developers.com/files/2022/06/Enable-ECG-and-blood-pressure-monitoring-on-Galaxy-Watch-4-watch-screenshots-7.jpg\"><img alt=\"Galaxy Watch 4 developer mode turned on\" class=\"attachment-large size-large\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://www.xda-developers.com/files/2022/06/Enable-ECG-and-blood-pressure-monitoring-on-Galaxy-Watch-4-watch-screenshots-7.jpg\" width=\"800\" /></a>\n\n<p>Jump back to the device settings and select\u00a0<em>Developer options.\u00a0</em>Then, tap on the toggles next to the\u00a0<em>ADB debugging </em>and\u00a0<em>Debug over Wi-Fi</em> settings to enable them.</p>\n\n<a href=\"https://www.xda-developers.com/files/2022/06/Enable-ECG-and-blood-pressure-monitoring-on-Galaxy-Watch-4-watch-screenshots-8.jpg\"><img alt=\"Galaxy Watch 4 developer options in device settings\" class=\"attachment-large size-large\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://www.xda-developers.com/files/2022/06/Enable-ECG-and-blood-pressure-monitoring-on-Galaxy-Watch-4-watch-screenshots-8.jpg\" width=\"800\" /></a>\n<a href=\"https://www.xda-developers.com/files/2022/06/Enable-ECG-and-blood-pressure-monitoring-on-Galaxy-Watch-4-watch-screenshots-9.jpg\"><img alt=\"ADB debugging option in developer options on Galaxy Watch 4\" class=\"attachment-large size-large\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://www.xda-developers.com/files/2022/06/Enable-ECG-and-blood-pressure-monitoring-on-Galaxy-Watch-4-watch-screenshots-9.jpg\" width=\"800\" /></a>\n<a href=\"https://www.xda-developers.com/files/2022/06/Enable-ECG-and-blood-pressure-monitoring-on-Galaxy-Watch-4-watch-screenshots-11.jpg\"><img alt=\"Debug over Wi-Fi option in developer option on Galaxy Watch 4\" class=\"attachment-large size-large\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://www.xda-developers.com/files/2022/06/Enable-ECG-and-blood-pressure-monitoring-on-Galaxy-Watch-4-watch-screenshots-11.jpg\" width=\"800\" /></a>\n\n<p><em><strong>Note:</strong> If your watch is configured to connect to a Wi-Fi network, it should now automatically connect to the saved network and show you the IP underneath the Debug over Wi-Fi</em><em> option.

When you open the modded app on your phone, your Galaxy Watch 4 should connect automatically and you should be able to see the Blood Pressure and ECG tabs. You can follow the instructions provided in the app to set these features up. Once that&#8217;s done, add the ECG and blood pressure tiles to your watch and you&#8217;re good to go.</p>\n\n<a href=\"https://www.xda-developers.com/files/2022/06/Enable-Galaxy-Watch-4-ECG-and-blood-pressure-monitoring-on-any-device-13.jpg\"><img alt=\"Blood pressure tab on modded Samsung Health Monitor app on OnePlus 10 Pro\" class=\"attachment-large size-large\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https://www.xda-developers.com/files/2022/06/Enable-Galaxy-Watch-4-ECG-and-blood-pressure-monitoring-on-any-device-13-459x1024.jpg\" width=\"459\" /></a>\n<a href=\"https://www.xda-developers.com/files/2022/06/Enable-Galaxy-Watch-4-ECG-and-blood-pressure-monitoring-on-any-device-14.jpg\"><img alt=\"ECG tab in modded Samsung Health Monitor app on OnePlus 10 Pro\" class=\"attachment-large size-large\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https://www.xda-developers.com/files/2022/06/Enable-Galaxy-Watch-4-ECG-and-blood-pressure-monitoring-on-any-device-14-459x1024.jpg\" width=\"459\" /></a>\n\n<p>Before you start using these features, make sure to disable ADB debugging on your Galaxy Watch 4 or it will impact its battery life. To do so, head back to the Developer options and tap on the toggle next to the ADB debugging option.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s worth mentioning that since this method uses a modded Samsung Health Monitor app, you might encounter some expected issues.

It&#8217;s a large, blocky flagship with glass front and back and stainless steel flat sides &#8212; this latter part gives the phone its hefty, brick-like feeling. In my opinion, Apple&#8217;s flat boxy design looks good and gives the phone an authoritative, machine vibe that runs in contrast to most Android flagships, most of which are wrapped by gentle curvature. The Vivo X80 Pro definitely fits that vibe, with a soft frosted coating to its glass back that feels silky and slippery to my hands.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"iPhone 13 Pro Max and vivo x80 pro\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-650633\" height=\"600\" src=\"https://www.xda-developers.com/files/2022/06/DSC04539-1024x683.jpg\" width=\"900\" /></p>\n<div class=\"quotecenter\">\n  <figure class=\"wp-block-pullquote quotestyle\">\n    <blockquote class=\"centerquotestyle\">\n      <p>The iPhone 13 Pro Max being too big to be held comfortably is a widely shared view</p>\n    </blockquote>\n  </figure>\n</div>\n\n\n<p>I personally don&#8217;t love the in-hand feel of either phone: I&#8217;m not a fan of the slithery frosted back of the Vivo, and the iPhone 13 Pro Max&#8217;s flat sides results in angular corners that dig into my palm. These are, of course, just my opinions, but I do think the iPhone 13 Pro Max being too big to be held comfortably is a widely shared view. Aamir does find the Vivo X80 Pro to be perfect for his tastes, while sharing the same concerns around the blocky design of the iPhone.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"iPhone 13 Pro Max and Vivo X80 Pro in the hand\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-651215\" height=\"600\" src=\"https://www.xda-developers.com/files/2022/06/vivo-x80-pro-iphone-13-pro-max-xda-455545665667-1024x683.jpg\" width=\"900\" /></p>\n\n<a href=\"https://www.xda-developers.com/files/2022/06/vivo-x80-pro-iphone-13-pro-max-xda-4555456666.jpg\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"attachment-large size-large\" height=\"600\" src=\"https://www.xda-developers.com/files/2022/06/vivo-x80-pro-iphone-13-pro-max-xda-4555456666-1024x683.jpg\" width=\"900\" /></a>\n<a href=\"https://www.xda-developers.com/files/2022/06/DSC04599.jpg\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"attachment-large size-large\" height=\"600\" src=\"https://www.xda-developers.com/files/2022/06/DSC04599-1024x683.jpg\" width=\"900\" /></a>\n\n<p>Both screens look great &#8212; gorgeous, vibrant OLED panels that reach a peak refresh rate of 120Hz. iOS handles 120Hz a bit better than Vivo&#8217;s FunTouchOS in my opinion, as the iPhone&#8217;s animations appear a bit more fluid to my eyes. Maximum screen brightness is about even. The Vivo X80 Pro has a less blemished screen, with only a small hole-punch cut-out compared to the iPhone 13 Pro Max&#8217;s notch, so viewing full-screen videos is a bit more enjoyable on the Vivo X80 Pro.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"viewing full screen videos in the iPhone 13 Pro Max and Vivo X80 Pro\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-650643\" height=\"600\" src=\"https://www.xda-developers.com/files/2022/06/DSC04594-1024x683.jpg\" width=\"900\" /></p>\n<p>There&#8217;s a reason for that notch, however, as it houses not just a 12MP selfie camera but also Apple&#8217;s TrueDepth camera system &#8212; a series of sensors that can map our face in 3D for secure facial recognition. Vivo&#8217;s hole-punch houses just a normal selfie camera, but a more pixel-dense 32MP shooter. Vivo relies on Qualcomm&#8217;s 3D Sonic Max solution for its optical fingerprint sensor: so you get a wider fingerprint sensing area than most Android devices, with the ability for dual-fingerprint sensing and quicker setup and recognition. The Vivo does this implementation excellently, so you are unlikely to miss the iPhone 13 Pro&#8217;s face recognition.</p>\n<p>Powering these phones are the latest SoCs from Apple and Qualcomm: A15 Bionic for the iPhone 13 Pro Max, and Snapdragon 8 Gen 1 for the X80 Pro &#8212; even though Apple&#8217;s chip is technically a 2021 chip, it is still more powerful than the 2022 Qualcomm chip, but the difference will only be noticed for more complicated tasks like rendering videos.</p>\n<p>Apple doesn&#8217;t disclose RAM configuration or battery size, but teardowns have revealed that the iPhone 13 Pro Max packs 6GB of RAM with a 4,352 mAh battery, both are &#8220;less&#8221; than what the Vivo X80 Pro offers &#8212; 12GB of RAM with 4,700 mAh battery &#8212; but real-world results do not reflect that. Due to Apple having better hardware-software synergy than almost any Android phone, iPhones can be more efficient in performance, thus needing fewer GBs of RAM or smaller battery sizes. I&#8217;ll cover this more closely in the performance section, but spoiler alert &#8212; the iPhone 13 Pro Max has better battery life than the Vivo X80 Pro.</p>\n<p>Both phones pack all the flagship smartphone flourishes: stereo speakers, IP68 water and dust resistance, excellent haptics, and wireless charging. The iPhone 13 Pro Max&#8217;s speakers and haptics are noticeably better than Vivo X80 Pro&#8217;s, but in return, Vivo takes a major win in charging &#8212; it can charge <em>much, much faster</em> whether wired or wirelessly, and Vivo includes the charger in the package.</p>\n<hr />\n<h2>Apple iPhone 13 Pro Max vs Vivo X80 Pro: Cameras</h2>\n<p>For optics, the iPhone 13 Pro Max packs a straightforward triple 12MP lens setup covering the ultra-wide, wide, and telephoto focal length. Other than Apple&#8217;s Deep Fusion image processing algorithm and a night mode that turns on automatically, there are not many tricks or gimmicks to this iPhone camera &#8212; no pixel binning nor no specialty sideways lenses. The Vivo X80 Pro does a bit more, with a quad lens system including dual zoom lenses for two optical zoom lengths, and one of these latter lenses is propped up by a miniature gimbal system. There&#8217;s also Zeiss T-coating over every glass so they reduce lens flare, and the main and ultra-wide camera both use pixel binning technology to force a larger micron-pixel size. There&#8217;s just a lot more processing between when Vivo&#8217;s camera hardware snaps the photo and the shot showing up in the photo gallery. Helping matters is Vivo&#8217;s proprietary V1+, a dedicated imaging chip created solely to handle image processing. Apple has its own image processing hardware too, it&#8217;s just part of the A15 Bionic.</p>\n\n<a href=\"https://www.xda-developers.com/files/2021/09/iPhone-13-Pro-Max-XDA-235lkjlksf354aasfs.jpeg\"><img alt=\"iPhone 13 Pro Max\" class=\"attachment-large size-large\" height=\"600\" src=\"https://www.xda-developers.com/files/2021/09/iPhone-13-Pro-Max-XDA-235lkjlksf354aasfs-1024x683.jpeg\" width=\"900\" /></a>\n<a href=\"https://www.xda-developers.com/files/2022/05/vivo-x80-pro-xda-134455346364346634.jpg\"><img alt=\"Vivo X80 Pro\" class=\"attachment-large size-large\" height=\"600\" src=\"https://www.xda-developers.com/files/2022/05/vivo-x80-pro-xda-134455346364346634-1024x683.jpg\" width=\"900\" /></a>\n\n<p>Let&#8217;s first examine photo consistency across all the lenses. In the below set, taken under relatively ideal lighting conditions, we can see that the iPhone does a better job of keeping consistent color temperature between the main and ultra-wide lens, while Vivo&#8217;s exhibit some deviation in the shade of the sky. Both main cameras produced an excellent photo that was sharp, with the right level of contrast and accurate colors. Even when I zoomed in 100% to pixel peep, it was a virtual tie.

The difference in image sharpness between ultra-wide shots should be more pronounced at night, marking this as a win for the Vivo.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\" id=\"attachment_651575\" style=\"width: 910px;\"><img alt=\"collage of iphone and vivo shots\" class=\"size-large wp-image-651575\" height=\"675\" src=\"https://www.xda-developers.com/files/2022/06/ultrawidecollage-iphone-vs-vivo-1024x768.jpg\" width=\"900\" /><p class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-651575\">100% crops, ultra-wide shots, iPhone 13 Pro Max (left) and X80 Pro (right).</p></div>\n<p>The iPhone 13 Pro&#8217;s 3x zoom, however, is really good &#8212; perhaps the best telephoto zoom lens in the business.

But if we really push the zoom level &#8212; up to 15x, then the X80 Pro&#8217;s shot is a bit sharper because at the end of the day, having a periscope technology is always better than not having one.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\" id=\"attachment_651573\" style=\"width: 910px;\"><img alt=\"cropped samples\" class=\"size-large wp-image-651573\" height=\"675\" src=\"https://www.xda-developers.com/files/2022/06/5xvs3xvivoiphone-1024x768.jpg\" width=\"900\" /><p class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-651573\">Crops of a 3x iPhone 13 Pro Max shot (left) and a 5x X80 Pro shot (right).</p></div>\n<p>But that above scene is considered easy to shoot for modern smartphones, if we move to more challenging scenes such as low light conditions or against harsh backlight, then we start seeing Vivo&#8217;s superior hardware pull off some noticeable wins. In the below set, we can see it is now the iPhone that shows a deviation in color science between the main and ultra-wide camera because the iPhone 13 Pro Max&#8217;s ultra-wide doesn&#8217;t inherently pull in a lot of light naturally, it needed to use a two-second long night mode to produce the shot.

The Vivo X80 Pro cannot &#8212; if you begin filming with the main camera, then you can&#8217;t swap to the ultra-wide, and any zoom is digital zoom.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Still, the Vivo X80 Pro introduces a new &#8220;cinematic portrait&#8221; video mode and it is arguably as good as the iPhone 13 Pro Max&#8217;s own cinematic mode.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Overall, I&#8217;d say the Vivo X80 Pro&#8217;s camera system has a higher ceiling, but also a lower floor, meaning when the Vivo excels, it is very, very good, but there are some basic things like the ability to switch lenses while filming a video that Vivo still hasn&#8217;t gotten right. The iPhone 13 Pro Max is the more capable video camera and has a better telephoto zoom lens. But the differences are very narrow, and both are insanely amazing cameras that will not disappoint end users.</p>\n<hr />\n<h2>Apple iPhone 13 Pro Max vs Vivo X80 Pro: Software</h2>\n<p>This is yet another iOS vs Android showdown, and I think most readers have their opinions set already. But here&#8217;s my take: I have always preferred Android over iOS because the former is more customizable, and allows me to do more things (like <a href=\"https://www.xda-developers.com/how-to-sideload-install-android-app-apk/\">easily sideload apps</a>, or save files in a proper file system), but I am aware that iOS is more polished and is surrounded by a better hardware ecosystem and third-party app ecosystem.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\" id=\"attachment_650637\" style=\"width: 910px;\"><img alt=\"iPhone 13 Pro Max and Vivo X80 Pro\" class=\"size-large wp-image-650637\" height=\"600\" src=\"https://www.xda-developers.com/files/2022/06/DSC04555-1024x683.jpg\" width=\"900\" /><p class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-650637\">iOS 15 on the iPhone 13 Pro Max and FunTouch 12 on the Vivo X80 Pro.</p></div>\n<p>Those feelings definitely hold true for me while testing both of these phones side-by-side. Vivo&#8217;s FunTouch OS is highly customizable, allowing me to change animations for everything from the way the homescreen moves to fingerprint animations. I am also a fan of being able to open apps in floating windows which I do often. This latter part is a major reason why I carry an Android phone as my daily driver most of the time &#8212; I want to be able to multi-task on my phone. The iPhone 13 Pro Max, with that large screen, not being able to show more than one app at a time is frustrating.</p>\n\n<a href=\"https://www.xda-developers.com/files/2022/06/Screenshot_20220516_175220.jpg\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"attachment-large size-large\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https://www.xda-developers.com/files/2022/06/Screenshot_20220516_175220-461x1024.jpg\" width=\"461\" /></a>\n<a href=\"https://www.xda-developers.com/files/2022/06/Screenshot_20220601_161356.jpg\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"attachment-large size-large\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https://www.xda-developers.com/files/2022/06/Screenshot_20220601_161356-461x1024.jpg\" width=\"461\" /></a>\n<a href=\"https://www.xda-developers.com/files/2022/06/Screenshot_20220601_161403.jpg\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"attachment-large size-large\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https://www.xda-developers.com/files/2022/06/Screenshot_20220601_161403-461x1024.jpg\" width=\"461\" /></a>\n<a href=\"https://www.xda-developers.com/files/2022/06/Screenshot_20220601_161423.jpg\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"attachment-large size-large\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https://www.xda-developers.com/files/2022/06/Screenshot_20220601_161423-461x1024.jpg\" width=\"461\" /></a>\n<a href=\"https://www.xda-developers.com/files/2022/03/IMG_3461.jpg\"><img alt=\"oneui screenshot\" class=\"attachment-large size-large\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https://www.xda-developers.com/files/2022/03/IMG_3461-474x1024.jpg\" width=\"474\" /></a>\n<a href=\"https://www.xda-developers.com/files/2020/10/IMG_8597.jpg\"><img alt=\"iOS Smart Stack displaying Spotify music suggestions\" class=\"attachment-large size-large\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https://www.xda-developers.com/files/2020/10/IMG_8597-473x1024.jpg\" width=\"473\" /></a>\n<a href=\"https://www.xda-developers.com/files/2020/10/IMG_8598.jpg\"><img alt=\"iOS Smart Stack displaying shortcuts to send a Twitter DM or message a Facebook friend\" class=\"attachment-large size-large\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https://www.xda-developers.com/files/2020/10/IMG_8598-473x1024.jpg\" width=\"473\" /></a>\n<a href=\"https://www.xda-developers.com/files/2020/11/IMG_8732.jpg\"><img alt=\"iOS homescreen\" class=\"attachment-large size-large\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https://www.xda-developers.com/files/2020/11/IMG_8732-473x1024.jpg\" width=\"473\" /></a>\n\n<p>However, iOS being surrounded by a more polished ecosystem is something Android and Vivo still haven&#8217;t been able to match. I&#8217;m not just talking about synergy with other Apple devices, like the way I can record a voice memo on an iPhone and that same clip shows up on my iPad in a few seconds, or that I can access my MacBook&#8217;s homescreen files directly on the iPhone &#8212; those are all awesome features but require you to buy more Apple hardware. But even if you don&#8217;t own any other Apple hardware, you still benefit from getting better app support on an iPhone than on an Android phone. This isn&#8217;t that noticeable if you use only the most popular, globally-used apps &#8212; Facebook and Twitter will run just as well on Android as an iPhone. But if you use smaller regional apps, like say a banking app for Hong Kong, or a hotel check-in app in Singapore, or a taxi-hailing app in Italy, there&#8217;s a <em>high chance</em> the iOS version of the app runs much better.</p>\n<div class=\"quotecenter\">\n  <figure class=\"wp-block-pullquote quotestyle\">\n    <blockquote class=\"centerquotestyle\">\n      <p>iOS being surrounded by a more polished eco-system is something Android and Vivo still haven't been able to match</p>\n    </blockquote>\n  </figure>\n</div>\n\n\n<p>This means that even though my main SIM card is in an Android phone most of the year, I always have an iPhone nearby because of the superior app situation. And this is unlikely to be changing in the short term future.</p>\n<hr />\n<h2>Apple iPhone 13 Pro Max vs Vivo X80 Pro: Performance and Battery Life</h2>\n<p>It&#8217;s been well documented that the Apple A15 Bionic chip in the iPhone 13 Pro Max is a more powerful chip than the Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Gen 1 in the Vivo X80 Pro, and the benchmark numbers back that up again here. But the thing is, the <a href=\"https://www.xda-developers.com/qualcomm-snapdragon-8-gen-1/\">Snapdragon 8 Gen 1</a> is <em>still a very powerful</em>\u00a0silicon, so for most of my day-to-day usage, I don&#8217;t really see a difference in performance, it&#8217;s not like the iPhone 13 Pro Max was launching apps faster or able to process voice commands faster.</p>\n\n<a href=\"https://www.xda-developers.com/files/2022/06/IMG_4858.jpg\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"attachment-large size-large\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https://www.xda-developers.com/files/2022/06/IMG_4858-474x1024.jpg\" width=\"474\" /></a>\n<a href=\"https://www.xda-developers.com/files/2022/05/Screenshot_20220516_052123.jpg\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"attachment-large size-large\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https://www.xda-developers.com/files/2022/05/Screenshot_20220516_052123-461x1024.jpg\" width=\"461\" /></a>\n<a href=\"https://www.xda-developers.com/files/2022/06/IMG_C5FCD2E86029-1.jpeg\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"attachment-large size-large\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https://www.xda-developers.com/files/2022/06/IMG_C5FCD2E86029-1-474x1024.jpeg\" width=\"474\" /></a>\n<a href=\"https://www.xda-developers.com/files/2022/05/Screenshot_20220515_190701.jpg\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"attachment-large size-large\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https://www.xda-developers.com/files/2022/05/Screenshot_20220515_190701-461x1024.jpg\" width=\"461\" /></a>\n\n<p>Where I do notice is editing videos &#8212; I shoot a lot of video clips and I usually give the clips a quick trim and occasional crop (directly in the phone&#8217;s native photo gallery app) before I upload to Instagram, and the rendering process is instantaneous most of the time on an iPhone 13 Pro Max, but would require a 10-second wait on the Vivo X80 Pro. Likewise, when I&#8217;m exporting 360 videos via Insta360&#8217;s app, the process is much faster on an iPhone than on any <a href=\"https://www.xda-developers.com/best-android-phones/\">2022 Android flagship</a> too.</p>\n<div class=\"quotecenter\">\n  <figure class=\"wp-block-pullquote quotestyle\">\n    <blockquote class=\"centerquotestyle\">\n      <p>The Apple A15 Bionic chip is more powerful than the Snapdragon 8 Gen 1, but you won't notice it in most daily tasks</p>\n    </blockquote>\n  </figure>\n</div>\n\n\n<p>Other general performance areas favor the iPhone too: Apple&#8217;s device has a louder, fuller speaker setup, better haptics, and better battery life. In fact, the iPhone 13 Pro Max has probably the best battery life of any phone I&#8217;ve tested in the last couple of years &#8212; I can finish entire 12-, 13-hour days with well over 30% of juice to spare. No Android flagship phone in the 120Hz screen era has been able to achieve this. Still, the Vivo X80 Pro is usually able to last a full 12-13 hour day too (just with less battery left at the end), so this isn&#8217;t really a big deal to me. Whether I make it home with 32% or 17% battery left doesn&#8217;t really matter that much. Plus, the Vivo X80 Pro can charge much faster and the charger is included, so those are solid wins.</p>\n<hr />\n<h2>Apple iPhone 13 Pro Max vs Vivo X80 Pro: Which phone is better?</h2>\n<p>If you&#8217;re keeping score at home, I got the Vivo X80 Pro winning in photography, software in terms of productivity, and display immersion for viewing content. But the iPhone 13 Pro Max is a better video camera, has better battery life, and is more powerful for intensive tasks like heavy gaming or editing/rendering videos.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"iphone 13 pro max and vivo x80 pro\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-650623\" height=\"600\" src=\"https://www.xda-developers.com/files/2022/06/DSC04054-1024x683.jpg\" width=\"900\" /></p>\n<p>There&#8217;s also the value factor, which is arguably a win for Vivo: both the iPhone 13 Pro Max and the Vivo X80 Pro are priced at roughly the $1,100 range in most parts of the world, but Vivo&#8217;s phone comes with a screen protector, a nice faux-leather case, wired earbuds, and a fast charger. In regions like India, the difference between the iPhone 13 Pro Max and the Vivo X80 Pro goes above $640 (~$750 if you compare the 256GB variants), at which point, the Vivo X80 Pro just wins hands down for pure value.</p>\n<p>But ultimately, this entire versus piece is mostly an exercise for enthusiasts or the curious, because the reality is iOS users are likely not going to jump to Android on a whim, and the iPhone 13 Pro Max is a much easier purchase for major chunks of the world including the US. But still, if you are on the market for a new phone and the Vivo X80 Pro is available in your area, you can at least know you&#8217;re getting a tip-top premium Android phone with the best still photo camera around.</p>\n<div class=\"nanobox-topofpage\">\n<div class=\"xda_nanobox\">\n<ul class=\"nanobox-title\">\n  <a href=\"https://shop-links.co/1768337731120597860?u1=de471a19-7610-43b6-beed-843fe5b076d2\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><h4 class=\"nanobox-product-title\">Apple iPhone 13 Pro Max</h4></a>\n</ul>\n<div class=\"nanobox-col-md-4 nanobox-col-sm-6\">\n  <ul class=\"nanobox-reco-features-image\">\n<a href=\"https://shop-links.co/1768337731120597860?u1=de471a19-7610-43b6-beed-843fe5b076d2\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"Apple iPhone 13 Pro Max\" class=\"wp-image-10741 nano-img\" src=\"https://www.xda-developers.com/files/2021/09/iphone-13-pro-max.jpg\" width=\"213\" /></a>\n  </ul>\n     </div>\n<div class=\"nanobox-col-md-8 nanobox-col-sm-6\">\n<ul class=\"nanobox-recodesc\">\nThe iPhone 13 Pro Max is the biggest and baddest Apple has to offer in the mobile space.

It remains one of the best wearables available out there and continues to blow our minds with each annual upgrade. What makes solid hardware so great is rich software that utilizes the internals and makes the most out of their power &#8212; efficiently. This is what makes software updates so exciting. Every year, we receive a major set of new features that give our same watches a new life to them. They feel brand new, thanks to the refreshed software elements and introduced additions. To get your hands on the latest features, you can easily <a href=\"https://www.xda-developers.com/how-to-install-watchos-beta/\">install watchOS beta</a> builds. However, the important question is &#8212; should you? Here&#8217;s what you need to know.</p>\n<p>We get it, trying out new features can be very tempting. That comes with risks, though &#8212; especially in Apple Watch&#8217;s case. That&#8217;s because if the beta version is too unstable or buggy, you can&#8217;t roll back to a stable build without visiting an Apple Store or authorized repair center. So you will remain stuck on beta until Apple releases a newer, stable build. That&#8217;s not to mention that some beta updates can brick your watch. While you can <a href=\"https://www.xda-developers.com/how-to-restore-apple-watch-iphone/\">restore it with an iPhone</a>, sometimes this method doesn&#8217;t work. In that case, you&#8217;d have to get it repaired at an authorized place.</p>\n<p>So should you install the watchOS beta? If there&#8217;s an authorized repair center where you reside, then the risk isn&#8217;t as big. That&#8217;s because you can just get it fixed if things go wrong. However, if you can&#8217;t repair in your region, then the wiser decision would be to refrain from switching to beta. Nobody wants to travel just for the sake of reviving a dead Apple Watch &#8212; I think.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s also worth pointing out that even if you don&#8217;t brick your watch on beta, some features might still not work. If you religiously depend on your Apple Watch in your day-to-day life, a smart idea would be to stick to stable watchOS. Now that you know the risks, you can evaluate and decide accordingly.</p>\n<div class=\"nanobox-topofpage\">\n<div class=\"xda_nanobox\">\n<ul class=\"nanobox-title\">\n  <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Apple-Watch-Midnight-Aluminum-Sport/dp/B09HF6XBPF/?tag=xdadev04-20\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><h4 class=\"nanobox-product-title\">Apple Watch Series 7</h4></a>\n</ul>\n<div class=\"nanobox-col-md-4 nanobox-col-sm-6\">\n  <ul class=\"nanobox-reco-features-image\">\n<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Apple-Watch-Midnight-Aluminum-Sport/dp/B09HF6XBPF/?tag=xdadev04-20\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"Apple Watch Series 7\" class=\"wp-image-10741 nano-img\" src=\"https://www.xda-developers.com/files/2021/10/ML783_VW_34FRwatch-45-stainless-silver-cell-7s_VW_34FR_WF_CO.jpeg\" width=\"213\" /></a>\n  </ul>\n     </div>\n<div class=\"nanobox-col-md-8 nanobox-col-sm-6\">\n<ul class=\"nanobox-recodesc\">\nThe Apple Watch Series 7 has a larger display and a more rugged frame compared to its predecessor.\n</ul>\n  <ul class=\"nanobox-product-cta\">\n<a class=\"button\" href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Apple-Watch-Midnight-Aluminum-Sport/dp/B09HF6XBPF/?tag=xdadev04-20\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><span class=\"xda_btn-content\">View at Amazon</span><i class=\"icon fa fa-arrow-right\"></i></a>                                                                                                            </ul>\n</div>\n  </div>\n\t  </div>\n<div style=\"clear: both;\"></div>\n\n\n<p><em>Will you be installing watchOS beta on your Apple Watch?

With every major iPadOS release, Apple further boosts these glass slabs with new features. The company is slowly removing the limits and constraints iOS has left behind in this operating system. It still doesn&#8217;t offer the liberties of a Mac, but it&#8217;s now much more advanced than an iPhone. It&#8217;s easy to install <a href=\"https://www.xda-developers.com/?p=647815&amp;preview=true\">iPadOS beta</a>\u00a0to try out Apple&#8217;s latest additions to the platform. Though, is it wise to do so? New features can indeed be tempting. However, pre-release builds can be riddled with bugs and unexpected behavior. Here&#8217;s our advice to you.</p>\n<p>Unlike the Apple Watch, downgrading to a stable build in an iPad is relatively easy and doable at home. So if you dislike the iPadOS beta experience, you can switch back to the stable version of the OS. So you can at least try the beta out and decide if it&#8217;s for you or not &#8212; assuming you know what you&#8217;re doing. If this sounds all confusing to you, it&#8217;s smart to avoid beta OS builds.</p>\n<p>Additionally, if you use your iPad for work or studies, it&#8217;s not the greatest idea to enroll it in the beta program. Apps and core features could glitch or break completely. If your iPad is just a media consumption or entertainment device, then perhaps there&#8217;s no harm in running iPadOS beta on it. Ultimately the decision isn&#8217;t permanent, and you could always undo it if you change your mind with the help of a computer.</p>\n<p>Personally, I&#8217;ve been running iPadOS beta builds on my daily driver for the longest time. I&#8217;ve never encountered any deal-breaking bugs so far. Sometimes the battery life takes a hit or the user interface of some system elements glitch &#8212; nothing too extreme, in my opinion. If you seek a polished operating system, then definitely avoid the beta.</p>\n<div class=\"nanobox-topofpage\">\n<div class=\"xda_nanobox\">\n<ul class=\"nanobox-title\">\n  <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/2022-Apple-iPad-10-9-inch-Wi-Fi/dp/B09V3HN1KC?tag=xdadev04-20\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><h4 class=\"nanobox-product-title\">Apple iPad Air 5 (2022)</h4></a>\n</ul>\n<div class=\"nanobox-col-md-4 nanobox-col-sm-6\">\n  <ul class=\"nanobox-reco-features-image\">\n<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/2022-Apple-iPad-10-9-inch-Wi-Fi/dp/B09V3HN1KC?tag=xdadev04-20\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"Apple iPad Air 5 (2022)\" class=\"wp-image-10741 nano-img\" src=\"https://www.xda-developers.com/files/2022/03/iPad-Air-5-Space-Grey.png\" width=\"213\" /></a>\n  </ul>\n     </div>\n<div class=\"nanobox-col-md-8 nanobox-col-sm-6\">\n<ul class=\"nanobox-recodesc\">\nThe new 5th-generation iPad Air is powered by the Apple M1 processor.

Thanks for joining us! Let&#8217;s start with your background. Where have you worked in the past, where are you from, how did you learn how to program, what languages or frameworks do you like, etc?</strong></p><blockquote><p>I&#8217;m a 39 year old female nerd, born and raised a bit north of Frankfurt, Germany and currently residing a bit to the east of Frankfurt, Germany - I haven&#8217;t come far, geographically speaking. I learned programming very early in my life, around six or seven years of age when my parents got an old <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_IIe\">Apple //e</a> from my uncle, and my attempts to play on it were met with a stern &#8220;this is a tool, not a toy&#8221; by my dad, briefly followed by teaching me the first commands of BASIC. Programming felt like being able to build with LEGO, but without the bricks ever running out, so I developed a passion for it very early.</p><p>I studied Computer Science at university, then went into the industry at a custom solutions and consulting company, where I helped customers build the tools they needed first as a Software Engineer and then later as a Technical Architect. Back then I mostly used Java with some JS and also ActionScript sprinkled in, but in my free time, I started working on a little pet project now known as OctoPrint that I implemented in Python for the backend and HTML/JS for the frontend.&nbsp;</p></blockquote><p><strong>What&#8217;s your most controversial programming opinion?</strong></p><blockquote><p>Tabs for indentation, spaces for alignment. Yes, that means mixing them (I can hear some people groan in disgust), but that also means using them for exactly what they were built for, and giving you full control of your whitespace.</p><p>Given that I primarily code in Python these days, however, I&#8217;ve yielded to PEP8 (the Python code style guide) and now use spaces exclusively.</p></blockquote><p><strong>What are some of the things you did that contributed the most to your growth as a developer over the course of your career? And what are some things you probably should have done that you didn't do?</strong></p><blockquote><p>I think one of the biggest contributing factors was certainly that I tend to view problems that arise as an opportunity to learn - and I was one of those kids that put down &#8220;learning&#8221; as a hobby in these &#8220;These are all my friends&#8221; books that used to make the round on the school yards in the 90s. Running into bugs that had me scratch my head for days or weeks with next to no progress were frustrating, but usually meant that by the time I did solve them I had internalized another fact of development life (e.g. &#8220;race conditions are the bane of your existence&#8221;) and sometimes also the <a href=\"https://foosel.net/blog/2021-03-19-on-wrong-assumptions\">one</a> or <a href=\"https://foosel.net/blog/2021-05-09-a-debugging-story\">other</a> fun story to tell.&nbsp;</p><p>Something that I should have done and didn&#8217;t do until now is learn to say &#8220;no&#8221; more and also fight a bit more against my perfectionism. The latter turns out to be great to create stable, reliable and nice to use software, but combined with the former can be a path into burnout, and that is something I now face and have to figure out how to resolve.</p></blockquote><p><strong>What is your favorite software tool?</strong></p><blockquote><p>That&#8217;s a hard choice to make between Git and VSCode.</p></blockquote><p><strong>If you had to suggest 1 person developers should follow, who would it be?</strong></p><blockquote><p><a href=\"https://www.hanselman.com/\">Scott Hanselman</a>. A whole person, not just another &#8220;I&#8217;m only about tech&#8221; person. Wholesome, educational, and all in all human. His approach to life, job, and community is what I aspire to.</p></blockquote><p><strong>If you could teach every 12-year-old in the world one thing, what would it be and why?</strong></p><blockquote><p>Systematic problem solving. You see it so often that people encounter a problem and then spend an excessive amount of time poking at it in a completely inefficient way. Trying things that have nothing to do with the problem, changing too many variables at the same time, growing increasingly frustrated about their inability to solve it and finally often lashing out at others out of frustration. I think if everyone got taught early on how to identify a problem, divide it into sub components, systematically test out possible solutions one by one, and also be aware enough to stop and step back when it requires knowledge to solve they don&#8217;t have, there would be way less anger, frustration and broken stuff in this world.</p></blockquote><p><strong>What are you currently learning?</strong></p><blockquote><p>I&#8217;m currently reading through the second edition of Luciano Ramalho&#8217;s &#8220;Fluent Python&#8221; and am learning a ton of stuff I didn&#8217;t yet know (or had forgotten again) about Python internals, like fun interactions between the += operator and a tuple part (page 54). I&#8217;m always very much interested in not just the syntax of a language but also what goes on underneath the surface and why (e.g. why does a seemingly atomic operation behave like it behaves), and that is stuff that I can learn here. I can only recommend this book! </p><p>Additionally, I&#8217;m on a continuing journey of beating my fear of heights AND combating the sedentary lifestyle of the coder by going bouldering twice per week and making slow progress on the difficulty levels I can actually conquer (for the curious reader: still only at V1 level, slowly pushing into V2, after long breaks, first pandemic/lockdown induced, then thanks to a knee surgery and recovery).</p><p>And earlier this year I finally started to figure out how to make a good baguette reliably (I took up bread baking as a hobby in early 2019), and that&#8217;s something I intend to fine tune at every future occasion! &#129366;</p></blockquote><p><strong>How do you separate good project ideas from bad ones?</strong></p><blockquote><p>Usually, I listen to my gut feeling and seek feedback from people I trust - I pitch them my idea, see how they react, and what points for and against it they raise (the biggest against point is usually &#8220;but don&#8217;t you already have enough on your hands with OctoPrint&#8221; which I can only agree with sadly) and if they think it&#8217;s a great idea overall or more a case of a brain fart on my part.</p></blockquote><p><strong>Why was OctoPrint started?</strong></p><blockquote><p>It was November 2012 and I had just acquired my first 3d printer. And now that thing was sitting on my office floor, tethered to my PC (because back then when controllers that were capable of printing from an SD card or a USB stick were the exception, not the rule, and also really expensive), producing noise, fumes and keeping my PC busy for hours. I wanted to be able to move that thing out of the office and into a spare bathroom, tethered to one of these little Raspberry Pis that had just come out that year, and figured there must surely be some kind of software that would allow me to do that and then monitor the print via WiFi and a browser. It turns out, no, there wasn&#8217;t yet a solution like I wanted it, with a full feedback loop. And so I sat down and wrote a solution for this problem of mine, over the course of my Christmas break that year. I figured it was done as soon as it did what I needed it to do, threw it up on GitHub, returned to my day job, and then suddenly got overrun with emails, feature requests, bug reports, in short, a TON of interest. Apparently, I had solved not just my problem. And since then this little project, now called OctoPrint, has taken over my life.</p></blockquote><p><strong>Where did the name for OctoPrint come from?</strong></p><blockquote><p>That came to be during a Google+ discussion on a new name for what is now OctoPrint. When I just wrote it for myself I called it first &#8220;CuraWebUI&#8221; (as it was based heavily on the printer driver of Cura), and then later after some refactoring &#8220;PrinterWebUI&#8221;. Not the best name. So I sought help online, for a name and a logo. A good friend of mine, <a href=\"https://www.splitbrain.org/\">Andreas Gohr</a> of DokuWiki fame, said, whenever he searches for a new project name, he looks for a cute animal, preferably one with tentacles, and goes from there. At which point my best friend <a href=\"https://twitter.com/zwergimbikini?lang=en\">Janina Himmen</a> of sp-studio.de fame threw a picture of an octopus into the ring, which prompted Andi to go &#8220;OctoPrint!&#8221;, and me to say &#8220;We are not calling it OctoPrint!&#8221; because I rather wanted to go into the direction of remote monitoring via a crystal ball. Which then resulted in my best friend drawing up another picture of the aforementioned octopus squeezed uncomfortably into a crystal ball, and at that point, I felt so bad for the little guy that the name and the mascot just stuck.</p></blockquote><p><strong>Who, or what was the biggest inspiration for OctoPrint?</strong></p><blockquote><p>I think you could say that in a way, CUPS was an inspiration. I figured, if I can put a paper printer on my network, send it print jobs and get metrics back from it, this should also be possible with a 3d printer, right? But overall, there wasn&#8217;t that big of an inspiration, it was a classic case of &#8220;I have a problem here, so I&#8217;m going to write a solution for it&#8221;.</p></blockquote><p><strong>Are there any overarching goals of OctoPrint that drive design or implementation? If so, what trade-offs have been made in OctoPrint as a consequence of these goals?</strong></p><blockquote><p>One big defining feature of OctoPrint is its ability to get extended massively in all kinds of directions through the use of plugins. So naturally, a big driver for design and implementation is first of all enabling modification of behaviour through plugins, but also keeping the existing interfaces and mechanisms backwards compatible as much as possible (and if not possible, give ample warning through deprecation notices). Especially the latter means that wrong decisions made in architecture years ago are now very hard to iron out as third party code depends on them, that a lot of time has to be spent on making code error resilient so that a misbehaving plugin doesn&#8217;t crash the whole platform, and it also means that some things cannot be as high performance as I&#8217;d like them to be simply because that would lock out certain parts of the platform for plugins.</p></blockquote><p><strong>What was the most surprising thing you learned while working on OctoPrint?</strong></p><blockquote><p>The amount of time spent on maintenance that doesn&#8217;t involve writing even a single line of code, and that often goes completely unnoticed by a project&#8217;s users. And the mind-boggling amount of entitlement that people have with regards to open source projects provided to them completely free.</p></blockquote><p><strong>What is the release process like for OctoPrint?</strong></p><blockquote><p>OctoPrint doesn&#8217;t have a fixed release schedule but rather new releases get made whenever enough fixes, improvements, and features have accumulated on the maintenance branch, and/or it&#8217;s been over three months since the last release. Once that happens, a feature freeze is established, and the branch finalized. Then a first release candidate is pushed out for anyone subscribed to the RC release channel. Feedback is collected, more RCs are pushed out if needed (e.g. in case of malfunctioning new features or regressions) until finally the call is made to go for a stable release.</p><p>In all cases, a release requires completion of a rather lengthy checklist that includes translation updates, error tracking ID switches, updates of the list of financial supporters, a whole gauntlet of update tests against various base environments to run via a <a href=\"https://octoprint.org/blog/2020/07/29/automating-octoprints-release-tests/\">self-built testrig</a>, changelog compilation, authoring of an announcement post and finally merging, tagging, releasing and merging up into the development branches.</p></blockquote><p><strong>Is OctoPrint intended to eventually be monetized if it isn&#8217;t monetized already?</strong></p><blockquote><p>I wouldn&#8217;t call it monetization because it&#8217;s not that you have to pay in any way to get access to OctoPrint, but OctoPrint is 100% crowd-funded since 2016. I have a Patreon campaign, GitHub Sponsors account, Donorbox account, Liberapay, and also some corporate sponsors, ad revenue, and some collaborations with regards to ready-made kit sales. And that is what funds my full-time work on OctoPrint.</p></blockquote><p><strong>How do you balance your work on open-source with your day job and other responsibilities?</strong></p><blockquote><p>That&#8217;s simple and very very complicated at the same time. I turned working on my open-source project OctoPrint into my crowd funded day job. I try to keep a good work/life balance through the use of strict work hours and an enforcement of weekend and vacation downtimes. Sometimes that fails spectacularly, and recently OctoPrint has really eaten up more than I could give. I&#8217;m working on fixing that situation.</p></blockquote><p><strong>Do you think any of your projects do more harm than good?</strong></p><blockquote><p>I sometimes wonder if the project is doing ME more harm than good, at which point it&#8217;s time to take a step back and breathe. Apart from that though, no, I don&#8217;t think so. In fact, I&#8217;ve gotten a lot of feedback that it has done a TON of good for people.</p></blockquote><p><strong>Are there any other projects besides OctoPrint that you&#8217;re working on?</strong></p><blockquote><p>Yes, some small electronics projects here and there, and one slightly larger pet project that is however still super secret to keep the pressure low - working on an MVP there, but considering my workload with OctoPrint, this is more a slow cooked meal than fast food, and I don&#8217;t know if and when I&#8217;ll share. If OctoPrint has taught me anything, then it is that projects can kinda take on a life of their own and take over yours as well in the process, and that&#8217;s why I&#8217;m being very careful about any bigger or more ambitious projects these days, and why I usually share any smaller stuff with a big disclaimer of minimum or no maintenance.</p></blockquote><p><strong>Do you have any other project ideas that you haven&#8217;t started?</strong></p><blockquote><p>Probably more than I can count. I have a &#8220;some day&#8221; list of stuff, with no guarantees that this &#8220;some day&#8221; will ever happen. The day sadly only has 24 hours and the year only 365 days, and that makes everything a bit difficult in that regard &#128514;</p></blockquote><p><strong>Have you ever experienced burn-out and how did you deal with it?</strong></p><blockquote><p>As far as I know I've never experienced a full blown burnout, but I've come close enough a couple of times now that I know I don't want to. I recognize early warning signs and learned that I need to take care of myself and my mental health. In fact, I'm currently in the midst of recovering from a really close call after an insanely intense two years and an even worse start into 2022 that left me fully circling the drain by mid April.</p><p>At that point I decided I needed an emergency brake and break, and thus I took 2.5 weeks of PTO as soon as I could. Once I could think a bit more straight again I also started pondering on strategies to make OctoPrint sustainable again. I've gone through those in <a href=\"https://youtu.be/Rcd7yvOrJB0\">a recent video update</a> but tldr: I need to enable the community to get more involved by doing a knowledge dumping first, and making all the tasks not immediately related to code more visible, and then dare to step back, demand involvement and delegate more. It will be a long and possibly bumpy road for the rest of this year I think, but it's a road that needs to be traveled if I want to keep doing this.</p></blockquote><p><strong>What motivates you to continue contributing to OctoPrint?</strong></p><blockquote><p>It feels like my life&#8217;s achievement at this point. I learn through it, I can help people through it, and it&#8217;s a project I stand 100% behind, which is a huge contrast to the projects I had to do when I still had a &#8220;normal&#8221; job and where I often didn&#8217;t understand why anyone would ever want to use what I was forced to build the way I was forced to build it.</p></blockquote><div><hr /></div><p><em>Want to join the conversation about one of the projects featured this week?
