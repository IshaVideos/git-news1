Powell said another three-quarter-point hike is possible at the Fed&amp;rsquo;s next meeting in late July if inflation pressures remain high, although he noted that such increases would not be common.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;On Wednesday, the Fed&amp;rsquo;s policymakers hinted at two more rate hikes by the end of 2023, at which point they expect inflation to finally fall below 3 per cent, close to their target level. But they expect inflation to still be 5.2 per cent at the end of this year, much higher than they&amp;rsquo;d estimated in March.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;In its forecast, Fed officials espect unemployment rising up this year and next, reaching 4.1 per cent in 2024 &amp;mdash; a level that some economists said would risk a recession, as per news agency AP.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Borrowing costs have already seen a sharp rise acroos the US economy in response to the Fed&amp;rsquo;s moves, with the average 30-year fixed mortgage rate topping 5 per cent, its highest level since before the 2008 financial crisis, up from just 3 per cent at the start of the year.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Investments are impacted around the world as bonds to bitcoin have witnessed a decline this year as high inflation has forced the central banks to swiftly remove supports propped underneath markets early in the pandemic.

More than 95 per cent of cervical cancer is caused by sexually transmitted human papillomavirus. This is the fourth most common type of cancer in women globally, with 90 per cent of these women living in low-and middle-income countries.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;There are different strains of the human papillomavirus which spread through sexual contact. They are associated with most cases of cervical cancer.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Gardasil 9 is the HPV vaccine approved by the US Food and Drug Administration and can be used for both men and women.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;If the vaccine is given before a female is exposed to the virus, most cases of cervical cancer can be prevented.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;According to Mayo Clinic, males who are vaccinated against the type of human papillomavirus associated with cervical cancer may help protect females from the virus by possibly decreasing the risk of transmission.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;About SII's Quadrivalent HPV Vaccine&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;The SII's tetravalent or quadrivalent HPV vaccine includes L1 virus-like particles (VLPs) of serotypes 6, 11, 16, and 18. A quadrivalent vaccine works by stimulating an immune response against four different antigens, such as four different viruses or other microorganisms. For instance, Gardasil is a quadrivalent vaccine that protects the body against infection with four different types of human papillomavirus. Meanwhile, Gardasil 9 is a nine-drug vaccine which provides protection against human papillomavirus types 6, 11, 16, 18, 31, 33, 45, 52, and 58.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;The L1 protein is sufficient to form virus-like particles, which are molecules that mimic viruses but are not infectious. These particles are an effective way of creating vaccines against diseases caused by human papillomavirus, hepatitis B virus, among others.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What Does The WHO Say About HPV Vaccine?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;According to the World Health Organization (WHO), a single-dose human papillomavirus vaccine delivers solid protection against human papillomavirus.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Dr Alejandro Cravioto, Chair of the WHO Strategic Advisory Group of Experts on Immunization (SAGE), said the HPV vaccine is highly effective for the prevention of HPV serotypes 16 and 18, which cause 70 per cent of cervical cancer, according to a statement released by the UN health agency.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;SAGE recommends a one or two-dose schedule of human papillomavirus vaccine for girls aged nine to 14 years, a one or two-dose schedule for young women aged 15 to 20 years, and two doses with an interval of six months for women above 21 years of age.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;", "link": "https://news.abplive.com/health/serum-institute-developed-quadrivalent-human-papillomavirus-vaccine-for-cervical-cancer-patients-9-to-26-years-1537507", "published_js": "2022-06-15", "author": "ABP News Bureau"}]}}};
