In situations of conflict and emergencies and humanitarian crises, they are particularly vulnerable, both in terms of their safety and also in terms of their being able to look after their families and feed their families,&quot; she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Observing that women play essential roles at the household and community levels, she told lawmakers that they are the front-line caretakers and mothers of children. They are the providers and processors and producers of food, and they are income earners, and they are leaders within their communities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Yet, they face disadvantages in being able to access productive resources such as employment, education, income, land, etc. That puts them at a disadvantage to fully play their roles,&quot; she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;So, by disadvantaging them in that way, you are holding them back, but you're also holding back their families, their households, their communities, and the economies of entire nations. So, in fact, a McKinsey report recently identified that in 2015, the cost to the global GDP is about USD28 trillion over a 10-year period if those inequality indicators were not improved, if the gap was not closed. So, it has economic consequences, as well as it's a rights issue,&quot; Gupta said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Describing herself as a first-generation immigrant, she said: &quot;I belong to a family of professional women, each of whom dedicated their lives to serving their communities and from a family of men who supported them fully.&quot; \tShe told lawmakers that she did her doctoral research in India on understanding the barriers that women face in pursuing a career, which ultimately, propelled her toward a career focused on rectifying the inequities experienced by women. &quot;That became both my passion and my profession,&quot; Gupta said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;From the women entrepreneurs in Kenya and India who sustain small businesses despite limited access to financial services, to the brave women in Liberia who mobilised against great odds to demand peace for their families and communities, I have seen women use the limited resources they have to provide for their families and protect others,&quot; she added.

But I want to reiterate. Americans should not be going to Ukraine. I say it again. Americans should not be going to Ukraine,&amp;rdquo; he said.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;In response to a question on India, Biden said, &quot;I have been to India twice and will be back. My relationship with (India is) very good&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Biden's remarks came a day after State Department spokesperson Ned Price said the US is there for India and reiterated that New Delhi's relationship with Moscow developed over several decades when Washington was &quot;not prepared or able to be a partner of choice&quot; for the Indian government.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Price was responding to a question on whether the US was talking with the Indian authorities as India and other Asian nations are becoming an increasingly vital source of oil revenues for sanctions-hit Russia, despite strong pressure from America.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&quot;We have had a number of discussions with our Indian partners, and the point that we have made is that every country is going to have a different relationship with Moscow,&quot; Price told reporters at his daily news conference on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Russia has overtaken Saudi Arabia to become India's second-biggest supplier of oil behind Iraq as refiners snap up Russian crude available at a deep discount following the war in Ukraine, industry data showed recently.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;India, the world's third-biggest oil-importing and consuming nation, has long defended purchases of crude oil from Russia following President Vladimir Putin ordering the invasion of Ukraine. The oil ministry had last month stated that &quot;energy purchases from Russia remain minuscule in comparison to India's total consumption.&quot; Price said India's relationship with Russia developed over several decades.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&quot;It developed over the course of decades at a time when the United States was not prepared or able to be a partner of choice for the Indian government,&quot; he said.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&quot;That has changed. This is a legacy of a bipartisan tradition now that has been the case for more than two decades. It goes back really to the Clinton administration, certainly to the George W Bush administration, where the United States has sought a partnership with India, has sought to be a partner of choice for India, including when it comes to the security realm,&quot; he said.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;This is not a partnership built in the course of days, weeks, or months, Price said.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&quot;I mentioned before that India's relationship with Russia was built up over the course of many decades, as countries reorient their relationship with Moscow, as we have seen many of them do. This will be a gradual process,&quot; he said in response to a question.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&quot;But throughout it all, we have made clear to our Indian partners that we are there for them. We are ready and able, and willing to partner with them. And we've done just that,&quot; Price said.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&quot;Of course, we had a '2+2' dialogue with our Indian partners not too long ago. We will see Prime Minister Narendra Modi once again in the context of the I2U2, the arrangement we have with the UAE and Israel, along with India, incorporating India into many of the partnerships we have, including, of course, the Quad,&quot; he said.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&quot;And that is a group this administration has sought to revitalise, and it has done so at very high levels,&quot; the official added.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;To re-energise and revitalise American alliances globally, the US, UAE, India and Israel have formed a new grouping called I2-U2. The four countries in the new grouping will hold their first virtual summit next month.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Quad comprises Japan, India, Australia and the United States.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The four countries in 2017 had given shape to the Quadrilateral coalition to counter China's aggressive behaviour in the Indo-Pacific region.&lt;/p&gt;", "link": "https://news.abplive.com/news/world/us-president-joe-biden-says-his-relationship-with-india-is-very-good-1537899", "published_js": "2022-06-17", "author": "PTI"}, {"title": "Pakistan To Remain On FATF 'Grey' List, Final Decision After Onsite Visit By Review Committee", "summary": "&lt;p&gt;The global terror financing watchdog Financial Action Task Force (FATF) on Friday said that it would not remove Pakistan from its &quot;Grey&quot; list after a meeting in Berlin which took place between June 14 to 17.

Makki, a US-designated terrorist, is the brother-in-law of Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) chief and 26/11 mastermind Hafiz Saeed.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Makki, 74, also known as Abdulrahman Maki, has occupied various leadership roles within LeT, a US-designated Foreign Terrorist Organisation (FTO). Both India and the US have already listed Makki as a terrorist under their domestic laws.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;On June 1, India and the US jointly proposed to list Makki under the UN Security Council's Al-Qaeda and ISIL Sanctions Committee which is also known as the UNSC 1267 Committee. But, China, a close ally of Pakistan, placed a &quot;technical hold&quot; on the proposal to list Makki and this measure can last for up to six months at a time.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;All decisions of the Committee are taken through consensus.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;In New Delhi, government sources said China's decision runs counter to Beijing's claim of combating terrorism and signals its &quot;double standards&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;He has been involved in raising funds, recruiting and radicalising youths to resort to violence and planning attacks in India, particularly in Jammu and Kashmir, they said.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Protecting well-known terrorists from sanctioning will only undermine China's credibility and &quot;risk exposing&quot; even itself more to the growing threat of terrorism, they said.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&quot;This decision by China is extremely unfortunate given the overwhelming evidence against Makki. Moreover, it runs counter to China's claims of combating terrorism,&quot; said a source.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;In Beijing, the Chinese foreign ministry on Friday defended its move, saying that its actions were in accordance with the relevant procedures and rules.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;I would like to say that China opposes all forms of terrorist attacks,&amp;rdquo;Foreign Ministry spokesman Wang Wenbin said when asked why China chose to put a hold on designating the known Pakistan-based terrorist.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;China&amp;rsquo;s actions at the UN Security Council 1267 Committee are always consistent with relevant rules and procedures. China will continue to conduct its work in a constructive and responsible manner,&amp;rdquo; he said in updated comments posted on the Foreign Ministry's website.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Asked to elaborate on his comments, especially on procedures and rules, Wang declined to go into the details.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;I have made China&amp;rsquo;s position clear. I&amp;rsquo;m not going to repeat myself,&amp;rdquo; he said.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Responding to another question about whether China's stand to put a hold on the designation of the wanted terrorist will add to the growing list of issues causing discord between India and China, he said: &amp;ldquo;On the listing of the person you mentioned, I just stated China&amp;rsquo;s position&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;On China-India relations, our attitude is consistent and clear. We hope the Indian side will work with us for the sound and steady development of bilateral relations&amp;rdquo; Wang said, amidst a chill in bilateral ties over the unresolved military standoff in eastern Ladakh.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Earlier also, China has placed holds and blocks on bids by India and its allies to list Pakistan-based terrorists.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;In May 2019, India had won a huge diplomatic win at the UN when the global body designated Pakistan-based Jaish-e-Mohammed chief Masood Azhar as a &quot;global terrorist&amp;rdquo;, a decade after New Delhi had first approached the world body on the issue.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;A veto-wielding permanent member of the UN Security Council, China was the sole hold-out in the 15-nation body on the bid to blacklist Azhar, blocking attempts by placing a &quot;technical hold&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;In 2009, India had moved a proposal by itself to designate Azhar. In 2016 again India moved the proposal with the P3 - the US, the UK and France in the UN's 1267 Sanctions Committee to ban Azhar, also the mastermind of the attack on the air base in Pathankot in January 2016.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;In 2017, the P3 nations moved a similar proposal again. However, on all occasions, China blocked India's proposal from being adopted by the sanctions committee.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Keeping up the international pressure to designate Azhar as a global terrorist, the US, supported by France and the UK, had moved a draft resolution directly in the UN Security Council to blacklist him.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;In November 2010, the US Department of the Treasury had designated Makki as a Specially Designated Global Terrorist.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;As a result of this designation, among other consequences, all property, and interests in property, of Makki that are subject to US jurisdiction are blocked, and US persons are generally prohibited from engaging in any transactions with Makki.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;In addition, it is a crime to knowingly provide, or attempt or conspire to provide, material support or resources to the Foreign Terrorist Organisation LeT,&amp;rdquo; the US said.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The US Department of State&amp;rsquo;s Rewards for Justice programme is offering a reward of up to USD 2 million for information on Makki.
