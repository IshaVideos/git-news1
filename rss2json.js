The Conservative Party MP was dissapointed with his boss' handling of economic policy through the tough post-pandemic times.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;Sunak was born and grew up in the coastal English town of Southampton. Recently during the UK-India Awards in Windsor, Sunak spoke of the sacrifices made by his National Health Service (NHS) general practitioner (GP) father Yashvir and pharmacist mother Usha.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;During the Covid pandemic, Sunak was widely praised for the economic rescue package he rolled out along a costly jobs retention programme that averted mass unemployment in the country. However, he faced criticism from some fractions for not giving enough cost-of-living support to households.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4. &lt;/strong&gt;The former minister stirred a controversy after Akshata Murthy, his wife and Narayana Murthy&amp;rsquo;s daughter, allegedly avoided payment of taxes on her overseas income. Sunak also faced scrutiny for allegedly not giving up his US green card while serving in the British government.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;Sunak was born to Indian parents who moved to Britain from East Africa. He attended the Winchester College private school and further studied in Oxford. Sunak has served as Chancellor of the Exchequer from 2020 to 2022, having previously served as Chief Secretary to the Treasury from 2019 to 2020.&lt;/p&gt;", "link": "https://news.abplive.com/news/world/rishi-sunak-political-career-who-is-rishi-sunak-indian-origin-british-politician-in-race-uks-next-pm-1541339", "published_js": "2022-07-07", "author": "ABP News Bureau"}, {"title": "Orange-Eyed Gecko And Family Of Pygmy Possums Are Living As Roommates In Western Australia", "summary": "&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;A family of pygmy possums and an orange-eyed gecko are living as roommates at Monjebup Nature Reserve in western Australia. Alex Hams, a land conservation manager at Bush Heritage Australia, an independent organisation that purchases and manages to land for conservation, discovered a nest box at the Monjebup Nature Reserve in western Australia in mid-June.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;It was a nest box for western pygmy possums, but Hams was surprised to see a reptile with the marsupials. Inside the box, pygmy possums and a small, orange-eyed gecko were living together, Bush Heritage Australia wrote on Twitter and Facebook.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;The lizard is a southwestern spiny-tailed gecko. Pygmy possums are tree-dwelling marsupials, which are mammals endemic to Australia, Wallacea and the Americas. A distinctive feature in most marsupials is that they carry their young in a pouch.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pygmy Possums And Southwestern Spiny-Tailed Geckos&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Pygmy possums can be as large as 12 centimetres from head to tail, and as small as five centimetres. Weighing between 10 grams and 50 grams, pygmy possums have large eyes, large ears and long whiskers. They also have a soft fur coat which is fawn to grey on top and white underneath.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;There are four species of pygmy possums, namely Western Pygmy Possum, Eastern Pygmy Possum, Tasmanian Pygmy Possum, and Long-tailed Pygmy Possum. The Long-tailed Pygmy Possum is found in Australia, Papua New Guinea and Indonesia, while the other three species are endemic to Australia.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;The southwestern spiny-tailed gecko, also known as the soft spiny-tailed gecko, is a lizard species endemic to Australia. They are arboreal species and capable climbers.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;ldquo;The Most Extraordinary Surprise&amp;rdquo;: Bush Heritage Australia&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Bush Heritage Australia wrote on Facebook that seeing a gecko and a family of pygmy possums sharing the same house is the &quot;most extraordinary surprise&quot;. The organisation said the team at the Monjebup Nature Reserve experienced a &quot;jaw-dropping moment&quot; when they peered into a nest box only to discover an orange-eyed southwestern spiny-tailed gecko cosied up with a family of western pygmy possums.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;According to the Facebook post, ecologist Angela Sanders said: &quot;The photos surprised us all&quot;.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Geckos are occasionally found in boxes. However, they have never been seen with possums. &quot;My best guess is that it is getting warmth from the possums. There is limited natural habitat for these animals in the revegetated area, so the boxes are providing vital shelter for them until the vegetation develops to a stage of providing cracks and crevices and loose bark,&quot; Sanders said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;According to an article published by the New York Times, Hams said the pygmy possums and the gecko were climbing all over each other and neither seemed to mind. He added that they were more concerned about the big human heads that were peering in through the top. This was something he had never seen before.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;In the following two weeks, Hams returned to the site and saw that nothing had changed. The pygmy possum mother, her litter of babies, and the two-to-three-inch gecko had not moved to any other place. The pygmy possums and the gecko were genuine roommates, and shared a crowded space that was no more than eight inches deep, the article stated.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Mr Hams said the boxes are small, and added that pygmy possums are so tiny that one could fit a whole family of them in the hand.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Several Australian mammals and birds depend on natural hollows for shelter. The interior of the box has a similar setup. Hams said the pygmy possums use the eucalyptus leaves from nearby trees to establish the nest.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why Were The Gecko And Pygmy Possums Sharing The Same House?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;According to Conrad Hoskin, a gecko expert from James Cook University in Australia, the pygmy possums and the gecko would have no interest in eating each other because possums consume nectar and insects and geckos feed on insects and spiders. Hoskin said that the gecko may be getting something from its nestmates, according to the article.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;He explained that the gecko will get some benefit from being in the warmth of those little mammals, and he suspects the presence of the gecko is neutral to the possum.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;According to Euan Ritchie, a professor in wildlife ecology and conservation at Deakin University in Melbourne, the pygmy possum has made a nest out of all the leaves and twigs, which is exactly the sort of habitat reptiles like. He further said that reptiles like structural complexity and this is a great place for a gecko to hang out.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;While the pygmy possums and geckos are cosied up in the same box, the mammals are unlikely to share their box with spiders. In 2019, dozens of social huntsman spiders took over one of the boxes. In the same year, a huntsman spider reportedly ate a pygmy possum in Tasmania. Around five per cent of the 103 boxes on the Monjebup Nature Reserve are estimated to be the domain of spider colonies, the article stated.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Dr Ritchie said tree hollows have been massively depleted around Australia because of logging, and pygmy possum habitat has become extremely fragmented. According to Dr Ritchie, hollows are likely to form in 100 to 150 years, depending on the tree and habitat.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;The vegetation on Monjebup is very young and undeveloped. It is only nine or 10 years old, and there are no habitats like natural hollows or crevices. Therefore, the nest boxes are the prime habitat, Sanders said. Also, animals that would not normally cohabit are forced together because there is so little habitat, she explained.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Bush Heritage Australia has placed artificial boxes on Monjebup Nature Reserve, which provide shelter for tiny honey possums and pygmy possums.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;", "link": "https://news.abplive.com/science/orange-eyed-gecko-and-family-of-pygmy-possums-are-living-as-roommates-in-western-australia-bush-heritage-australia-monjebup-nature-reserve-1541269", "published_js": "2022-07-07", "author": "ABP News Bureau"}, {"title": "What Songs Should Play When NASA Webb Releases First Image?

Johnson is believed to have called him up from Downing Street to inform him that he is fired from his ministerial post.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Amid ongoing speculation over his leadership, Johnson\u2019s parliamentary private secretary James Duddridge told \u2018Sky News\u2019 there will be a joint plan for the economy laid out by Johnson and Nadhim Zahawi, the new UK Chancellor, on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\u201cHe has a 14 million mandate and so much to do for the country,&quot; said Duddridge.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;I expect him to make senior Cabinet appointments this evening and am looking forward to hearing what the PM and his fantastic chancellor Nadhim Zahawi have to say tomorrow,\u201d he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other media reports also confirmed that Johnson has no plans of resigning, with a No. 10 Downing Street source saying the UK PM remains \u201cabsolutely defiant\u201d.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sir Graham Brady, the chair of the influential 1922 Committee of backbench Conservative MPs, has reportedly told its leader that the committee's executive election on Monday &quot;could result in another confidence vote&quot;, which Johnson is likely to lose.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;The PM is conscious he has a mandate from 14 million people (from 2019 general election) and the only way he will leave is if the party takes that mandate off him,&quot; a source close to Johnson was quoted as saying.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The 1922 Committee is responsible for setting the timetable for a Tory leadership contest. To take part in the race, a Tory MP has to be nominated by eight colleagues. If more than two MPs put themselves forward and secure enough nominations to run for leader, a series of secret ballots are held to whittle them down.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was thought that with a large chunk of his Cabinet now calling for his resignation, Johnson would give in and step down. However, it would now seem he is determined to fight on until he is voted out in a no-confidence showdown of Tory party members.

The BBC soon confirmed those reports that she along with Nadhim Zahawi, the newly appointed Chancellor to replace Sunak, were among the group of ministers threatening to resign unless Johnson accepts his time in Downing Street is up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Patel, 50, is joined by other loyalists such as UK Transport Secretary Grant Shapps and Welsh Secretary Simon Hart. The delegation of senior politicians, which also included Policing Minister Kit Malthouse, new Education Secretary Michelle Donelan and Chief Whip Chris Heaton-Harris are believed to have told Johnson that his position as PM is now unsustainable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It follows a day of high political drama in the heart of Westminster politics in London, with minister after minister stepping down \u2013 believed to be the highest number of UK government resignations in a day since the 1930s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The debate is now around exactly how this drama would end, whether Johnson would finally give in and resign or continue to hold on to his \u201ccolossal mandate\u201d from the electorate and demand a leadership election.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The influential 1922 Committee of Conservative Party backbenchers are reportedly holding urgent meetings with a view to make necessary rule changes so Johnson can be made to face a vote under the one-year timeframe currently in place after he won the last no-confidence vote in June.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Facing a grilling from the Parliament\u2019s powerful Liaison Committee, Johnson remained bullish as he insisted \u201cof course\u201d when asked if he would still be prime minister tomorrow. Asked about the mass exodus unfolding within his government, Johnson replied that \u201cthe government of the country is being carried on with ever-increasing energy\u201d.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Sir Bernard Jenkin, the Liaison Committee Chairman, had to spell things out for Johnson and also warn him not to call a snap general election that would plunge the country into further turmoil.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; \u201cI hope you will reflect that in the end we're all dispensable\u2026 and the welfare of the British people and the security of the nation are indispensable,\u201d said Jenkin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Johnson replied that he would consider resigning if he became an \u201cobstruction\u201d to protecting the country\u2019s vital interests, but then immediately insisted that \u201cI\u2019m not going to step down\u201d as he indicated that he did not expect a vote earlier than 2024 \u2013 when the next UK general election is due.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But with the ever-increasing volume of dissent within his own party ranks, the chances of a government led by him surviving until then are growing dimmer with every passing hour.

Education ministers Will Quince and Robin Walker and ministerial aide Laura Trott resigned on Wednesday, BBC reported.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Will Quince said he had &quot;no choice but to tender my resignation&quot;, while Laura Trott said she was quitting over a loss of 'trust' in the government. Johnson, who recently survived a leadership challenge, vowed to &quot;keep going&quot; as he appeared before several of parliamentarians, not only from the Opposition benches but from within his own Conservative Party.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The statement came after Johnson, 58, appeared at the weekly Prime Minister's Questions (PMQs) in the House of Commons amidst incresing pressure on him to resign over the handling of allegations of sexual misconduct by a member of his government.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Two of Boris Johnson's top ministers - Chancellor of the Exchequer Rishi Sunak and Health Secretary Sajid Javid - quit the government on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&quot;The job of a Prime Minister in difficult circumstances, when you've been handed a colossal mandate, is to keep going, and that's what I am going to do,&quot; Johnson said in response to repeated demands for him to quit.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&quot;It's exactly when times are tough, that when the country faces pressures on the economy and pressures on their budgets and when we have the biggest war in Europe for 80 years, that is exactly the moment that you'd expect a government to continue with its work, not to walk away, and to get on with the job,&quot; he said.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The exit of Sunak and Javid has left the Conservative Party leader in a precarious position as further resignations are expected.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;As per the current rules Johnson is safe from another leadership challenge until next summer.
