Johnson is believed to have called him up from Downing Street to inform him that he is fired from his ministerial post.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Amid ongoing speculation over his leadership, Johnson\u2019s parliamentary private secretary James Duddridge told \u2018Sky News\u2019 there will be a joint plan for the economy laid out by Johnson and Nadhim Zahawi, the new UK Chancellor, on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\u201cHe has a 14 million mandate and so much to do for the country,&quot; said Duddridge.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;I expect him to make senior Cabinet appointments this evening and am looking forward to hearing what the PM and his fantastic chancellor Nadhim Zahawi have to say tomorrow,\u201d he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other media reports also confirmed that Johnson has no plans of resigning, with a No. 10 Downing Street source saying the UK PM remains \u201cabsolutely defiant\u201d.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sir Graham Brady, the chair of the influential 1922 Committee of backbench Conservative MPs, has reportedly told its leader that the committee's executive election on Monday &quot;could result in another confidence vote&quot;, which Johnson is likely to lose.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;The PM is conscious he has a mandate from 14 million people (from 2019 general election) and the only way he will leave is if the party takes that mandate off him,&quot; a source close to Johnson was quoted as saying.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The 1922 Committee is responsible for setting the timetable for a Tory leadership contest. To take part in the race, a Tory MP has to be nominated by eight colleagues. If more than two MPs put themselves forward and secure enough nominations to run for leader, a series of secret ballots are held to whittle them down.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was thought that with a large chunk of his Cabinet now calling for his resignation, Johnson would give in and step down.

The BBC soon confirmed those reports that she along with Nadhim Zahawi, the newly appointed Chancellor to replace Sunak, were among the group of ministers threatening to resign unless Johnson accepts his time in Downing Street is up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Patel, 50, is joined by other loyalists such as UK Transport Secretary Grant Shapps and Welsh Secretary Simon Hart. The delegation of senior politicians, which also included Policing Minister Kit Malthouse, new Education Secretary Michelle Donelan and Chief Whip Chris Heaton-Harris are believed to have told Johnson that his position as PM is now unsustainable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It follows a day of high political drama in the heart of Westminster politics in London, with minister after minister stepping down \u2013 believed to be the highest number of UK government resignations in a day since the 1930s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The debate is now around exactly how this drama would end, whether Johnson would finally give in and resign or continue to hold on to his \u201ccolossal mandate\u201d from the electorate and demand a leadership election.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The influential 1922 Committee of Conservative Party backbenchers are reportedly holding urgent meetings with a view to make necessary rule changes so Johnson can be made to face a vote under the one-year timeframe currently in place after he won the last no-confidence vote in June.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Facing a grilling from the Parliament\u2019s powerful Liaison Committee, Johnson remained bullish as he insisted \u201cof course\u201d when asked if he would still be prime minister tomorrow. Asked about the mass exodus unfolding within his government, Johnson replied that \u201cthe government of the country is being carried on with ever-increasing energy\u201d.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Sir Bernard Jenkin, the Liaison Committee Chairman, had to spell things out for Johnson and also warn him not to call a snap general election that would plunge the country into further turmoil.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; \u201cI hope you will reflect that in the end we're all dispensable\u2026 and the welfare of the British people and the security of the nation are indispensable,\u201d said Jenkin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Johnson replied that he would consider resigning if he became an \u201cobstruction\u201d to protecting the country\u2019s vital interests, but then immediately insisted that \u201cI\u2019m not going to step down\u201d as he indicated that he did not expect a vote earlier than 2024 \u2013 when the next UK general election is due.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But with the ever-increasing volume of dissent within his own party ranks, the chances of a government led by him surviving until then are growing dimmer with every passing hour.

Ailurarctos were an ancient relative of the giant panda that lived in China six to eight million years ago, and are now extinct.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why Has The &amp;ldquo;Thumb&amp;rdquo; Not Enlarged Further?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;According to the study, the &quot;thumb&quot; has not enlarged further because it must be balanced with the constraints of weight bearing while walking in a plantigrade posture. Plantigrade foot posture is one in which the heel contributes to support of body weight during walking, running and standing. In other words, plantigrade posture is one in which the surface of the whole foot touches the ground during locomotion.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The &amp;ldquo;Thumb&amp;rdquo; Performs A Dual Function&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;The authors noted in the study that this morphological adaptation in panda evolution reflects a dual function of the radial sesamoid for both bamboo manipulation and weight distribution. The constraints of weight bearing could be the main reason why the panda's false thumb never evolved into a full digit. The crude &quot;thumb&quot; suggests that the origin of the panda's dedicated bamboo diet dates back to as early as six to seven million years ago.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So Far, There Was Lack Of Evidence About How The Extra Digit Evolved&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Though the panda's false thumb had been known for about a century, the lack of fossil evidence had left questions unanswered about how and when the extra digit, which is not seen in any other bear, evolved.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;The researchers found the enlarged radial sesamoid along with a broken canine and a partial humerus from the late Miocene site in the Zhaotong Basin, Yunnan Province.

However, bamboo had a year-round availability in South China and Southeast Asia millions of years ago. Depending on the season, pandas eat prodigious quantities of bamboo, up to 45 kilograms a day. They spend 15 hours a day eating.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Moreover, the panda's short digestive tract, which it inherited from its carnivoran ancestors, is poorly suited for extracting nutrients, absorbing less than 20 per cent of digestible dry matter.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;The paper said that while the giant panda's false thumb is not the most elegant or dexterous, the persistence of the distinctive morphology for the last six million years suggests that it has fulfilled an essential function for the survival of the lineage.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What Is The Purpose Of Small Muscles Between Radial Sesamoid And First Metacarpal?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;The paper also said that small muscles between the radial sesamoid and the first metacarpal (one of the five bones between the wrist and the fingers) serve as a cushion for the bamboo stems grasped between the radial sesamoid and the phalanges.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Though this passive system of gripping is far less effective than that of humans, it nonetheless offers the panda the tightness of grip it needs for bamboo feeding.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;According to the study, such a simple passive mechanism of grasping can be functionally useful from an evolutionary point of view, even with a slight initial enlargement of the radial sesamoid.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;The study said that natural selection would be effective from the early stages of enlargement. This means that even a small, protruding lump at the wrist can be a modest help in preventing bamboo from slipping off bent fingers.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;The authors noted in the study that the giant panda is a striking example of a highly specialised member of the bear family (Ursidae) that has become a dedicated herbivore.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;The study also said that the false thumb in Ailurarctos shows an intermediate morphology, and thus, documents for the first time the likely timing and steps in the evolution of bamboo feeding in plants.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;The authors concluded that the hook and the fleshy pad, which cushions the radial sesamoid, evolved over time because the false thumb had to bear the burden of considerable body weight.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;", "link": "https://news.abplive.com/science/six-million-years-old-fossils-unravel-mystery-of-how-pandas-developed-false-thumb-became-herbivorous-1541091", "published_js": "2022-07-06", "author": "Radifah Kabir"}, {"title": "Toronto To Reinstate Sikh Security Guards Fired Over No-Beard Policy", "summary": "&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;New Delhi: &lt;/strong&gt;The City of Toronto formally apologised to the World Sikh Organisation of Canada for &amp;ldquo;any delay&amp;rdquo; in reinstating the 100 Sikh security guards who were laid off over the &amp;ldquo;no-beard&amp;rdquo; policy, according to an ANI report.

Since sand is a very effective medium for storing heat and loses little over time, the developers believe the sand battery could keep sand at 500 degrees Celsius for several months.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Therefore, when energy prices increase, the battery can discharge the hot air. This air will warm the water for the district heating system, which is pumped around homes, offices and the local swimming pool.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Sand Battery May Benefit Food And Drink, Textile Industries&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Tampere, Finland was the place where the idea for the sand battery was first developed. According to the article, Elina Sepp&amp;auml;nen, an energy and climate specialist for Tampere, said if there are power stations that are just working for a few hours in the wintertime, when it is the coldest, it is going to be extremely expensive.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;She suggested that if there is a solution that provides flexibility for the use, and storage of heat, that would help a lot in terms of expense.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Certain challenges are associated with the sand battery, one of them being whether the technology can be scaled up to really make a difference. Also, an important question is whether the developers will be able to use the sand battery to generate electricity as well as heat.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;When the sand is used to return power to the electricity grid, the electricity falls dramatically, the article said. The fact that the sand battery can be used for storing green energy as heat should for a longer time not be undermined. This will benefit the food and drink, textiles and pharmaceutical industries where most of the heat used to conduct the processes is generated by burning fossil fuels. By avoiding the use of fossil fuels, climate change can be tackled.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;The US National Renewable Energy Laboratory is a research group actively looking at sand as a viable form of battery for green power.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Pekka Passi, the managing director of the Vatajankoski power plant, said the technology is really simple, but the researchers linked the idea of trying something new, &quot;to be the first in the world to do something like this&quot;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;", "link": "https://news.abplive.com/science/sand-battery-world-first-fully-working-sand-battery-know-how-this-green-energy-source-works-1541062", "published_js": "2022-07-06", "author": "ABP News Bureau"}, {"title": "India Asks Sri Lanka To Pay For Fuel In Advance As Credit Lines Exhausted: Report", "summary": "&lt;p&gt;As credit lines to Sri Lanka were exhausted, India is seeking payment in advance for supply of fuel to the island nation, citing sources, Bloomberg reported on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Quoting sources, the news agency reported that the Indian government officials said that New Delhi stopped supplying gasoline and diesel on credit after Sri Lanka ran out of dollars to purchase fuels amid its worst economic crisis. That&amp;rsquo;s holding up some fuel shipments pending cash payment by Sri Lanka&amp;rsquo;s Ceylon Petroleum Corp., according to the report.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Ceylon Petroleum&amp;rsquo;s cargo schedule tweeted by Sri Lankan Energy Minister Kanchana Wijesekera showed at least four shipments of gasoline and diesel from state-run refiner Indian Oil Corp. are pending confirmation of advance payment.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;India has already extended over $3.5 billion of support to Sri Lanka in the past few months for food, medicines, and fuel.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Sri Lanka, which has depleted its foreign exchange (Forex) reserves, was hoping for a fresh approval from India of a $500 million credit line for fuel purchases. Colombo has sent envoys to Qatar to secure fresh supplies and is also seeking oil from Russia.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Between March and June, Indian Oil has delivered about 450,000 tonnes of gasoline and diesel to Ceylon Petroleum, a spokesperson for the company said.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The fuel crisis has led to a shutdown of public schools and offices in Sri Lanka until July 10 to conserve fuel, even as thousands of vehicles continue to queue for miles waiting for filling stations to be replenished.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The bankrupt nation is offering a guaranteed fuel quota to companies that can pay dollars to Ceylon Petroleum in advance to ease the crippling shortages.

Governments often use these tools for predictive policing to deter crime.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;However, early efforts at crime prediction have been controversial. This is because systemic biases in police enforcement are not accounted for.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Researchers at the University of Chicago have developed a new algorithm that forecasts crime by learning that forecasts future crimes one week in advance with about 90 per cent accuracy. The algorithm learns patterns in time and geographic locations from public data on violent and property crimes.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;The researchers used a separate model to study the police response to crime by analysing the number of arrests following incidents and comparing those rates among neighbourhoods with different socioeconomic status.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;The study describing the results was recently published in the journal &lt;em&gt;Nature Human Behaviour&lt;/em&gt;.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Crime In Wealthier Areas Resulted In More Arrests&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;According to the study, the model showed that crime in wealthier areas resulted in more arrests, while arrests in disadvantaged neighbourhoods dropped. However, the model demonstrated that crime in poor neighbourhoods did not lead to more arrests, suggesting bias in police response and enforcement.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;In a statement released by University of Chicago, Ishanu Chattopadhyay, senior author on the new paper, said what the researchers saw is that when the system is stressed, it requires more resources to arrest more people in response to crime in a wealthy area. Also, stress on the system draws police resources away from lower socioeconomic status areas.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Two Broad Categories Of Crimes Considered&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;The study said that the tool was tested and validated using historical data from the City of Chicago around two broad categories of reported events. These events are violent crimes and property crimes. Violent crimes include homicides, assaults, and batteries. Property crimes include burglaries, thefts, and motor vehicle thefts.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;The researchers used historical crime data from Chicago because they were most likely reported to police in urban areas where there is historical distrust and lack of cooperation with law enforcement. These crimes are less prone to enforcement bias, similar to drug crimes, traffic stops and other misdemeanour infractions.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Earlier, crime prediction techniques used an epidemic or seismic approach, in which crime is depicted as emerging in &quot;hotspots&quot; that spread to surrounding areas. The drawback associated with these tools is that they miss out on the complex social environment of cities. Moreover, they do not consider the relationship between crime and the effects of police enforcement.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How The New Model Is Unique&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;James Evans, a co-author on the paper, said spatial models ignore the natural topology of the city. He added that transportation networks respect streets, walkways, train and bus lines, while communication networks respect areas of similar socioeconomic background. The model developed by the researchers at the University of Chicago enables discovery of those connections, he said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;New Model Divides The City Into Spatial Areas 1,000 Feet Across&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;According to the study, the new model isolates crime by looking at the time and spatial coordinates of discrete events and detecting patterns to predict future events. Instead of relying on traditional neighbourhood or political boundaries, which are subject to bias, the new model divides the city into spatial tiles roughly 1,000 feet across and predicts from within these areas. The model not only performed well with the data from Chicago, but also data from seven other cities in the United States, namely Atlanta, Austin, Detroit, Los Angeles, Philadelphia, Portland, and San Francisco.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Evans said the researchers demonstrated the importance of discovering city-specific patterns for the prediction of reported crime. This generates a fresh view on neighbourhoods in the city, allows researchers to ask novel questions, and lets them evaluate police action in new ways, he explained.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Tool Should Not Be Used To Direct Law Enforcement&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;According to the authors, the tool's accuracy does not mean that it should be used to direct law enforcement, with police departments using it to swarm neighbourhoods proactively to prevent crime. The tool should instead be used as a toolbox of urban policies and policing strategies to address crime.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Chattopadhyay said they created a digital twin of urban environments. If one feeds it with data from what happened in the past, it will tell them what is going to happen in the future.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;However, the model is not devoid of limitations. One can use the simulation tool to see what happens if crime goes up in one area of the city, or there is increased enforcement in another area. If one applies all these different variables, they can see how the system evolves in response.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;", "link": "https://news.abplive.com/science/ai-algorithm-predict-future-crimes-one-week-in-advance-with-90-percent-accuracy-know-more-details-1540687", "published_js": "2022-07-06", "author": "Radifah Kabir"}]}, "swarajyamag.com": {"feed": {"title": "swarajyamag.com"}, "entries": [{"title": "Does Roe v Wade Foreshadow The End Of The American Dream? -
