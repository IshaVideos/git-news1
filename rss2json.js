These researchers were the first to identify that stem cells in human urine have the potential for tissue regenerative effects, and are now continuing their investigation.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;In a new study, the researchers have focused on how telomerase activity affects the regenerative potential of stem cells in human urine and other types of stem cells. The study was recently published in the journal &lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Frontiers in Cell and Developmental Biology&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What Is Telomerase Activity?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Telomerase is an enzyme which is essential for the self-renewal and potential of different types of stem cells, and telomerase activity is closely related to longevity. The researchers investigated the regenerative significance of telomerase activity in terms of different factors including characteristic cell surface marker expression, multipotent differentiation capability and chromosomal stability&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Cell surface markers are special proteins expressed in the surface of cells or carbohydrates attached to the cell membrane, and often conveniently serve as markers of specific cell types. For instance, T cell and B cell surface markers identify their lineage and stage in the differentiation process.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Cell differentiation is the process by which dividing cells change their functional or phenotypical type. Multipotent differentiation capability of stem cells refers to the ability of those cells to differentiate into all cell types within one particular lineage. Multipotent stem cells have several advantages, including playing a key role in development, tissue repair and protection.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Chromosome stability mechanisms maintain the proper number of chromosomes during the cell cycle, and also prevent chromosomal aberrations.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Significance Of The Findings&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;The findings of the study provide a novel perspective to evaluate the capacity of telomerase-positive human urine-derived stem cells to become a wide variety of other types of cells. The study also provides a novel perspective for these stem cells to be used as an optimal cell source for stem cell therapy or cell-based tissue regeneration.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;In a statement released by Wake Forest University Baptist Medical Center, Yuanyuan Zhang, the lead author on the paper said that human urine-derived stem cells can be easily isolated from urine samples which offer clear advantages over stem cells from other sources. These sources include bone marrow or fat tissue, and often require a surgical procedure for collection.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Anthony Atala, a co-author on the paper, said being able to use a patient's own stem cells for therapy is considered advantageous because they do not induce immune responses or rejection. He added that additionally, the non-invasive collection method is suitable for rapid clinical translation.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;The study showed that human primary urine stem cells with positive telomerase activity act as a distinct subpopulation with potential regeneration capacity in both cell growth and its capacity to become other cells. It is important to understand the alterations in this cell subpopulation throughout the human lifespan, and how they translate into ageing, kidney damage or cancer, among others.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Zhang said as a safe cell source, telomerase-positive human urine-derived stem cells have a robust regenerative potential, which might induce better tissue repair.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;", "link": "https://news.abplive.com/science/stem-cells-derived-from-human-urine-could-have-several-benefits-new-study-suggests-1539923", "published_js": "2022-06-29", "author": "Radifah Kabir"}, {"title": "Sri Lanka Crisis: Fuel Duopoly To End, Oil-Producing Countries Allowed To Enter Market, Says Energy Minister", "summary": "&lt;p&gt;In a quest to get more fuel into Sri Lanka, the power and energy minister Kanchana Wijesekera on Tuesday said the duopoly controlling imports would be ended allowing companies from oil-producing countries to enter the market.
