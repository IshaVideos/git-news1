These galaxies from the early universe were hidden from our sight due to massive amounts of dust. With the help of these observations, the astronomers were able to measure the temperature and thickness of the dust, and demonstrate that this type of galaxies contributed significantly to the total star formation when the universe was only one-tenth of its current age.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;A fundamental method of describing the properties and evolution of galaxies is measuring the rate at which stars are born in galaxies across cosmic time. Astronomers eliminate this so-called star formation rate using various methods. The star formation rate is dependent on the light that is emitted from either the stars, or from matter that is illuminated by the stars.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;The study describing the findings has been accepted for publication in the journal &lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Astronomy and Astrophysics.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Findings On Cosmic Dust&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;The stars formed tend to create dust. These are particles made of heavy elements such as carbon, silicon, oxygen, and iron. Appearing as thick clouds in the space between the stars, the dust hides the stars completely from our eyes.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Since the dust hides the stars completely from our eyes, it becomes difficult to get a census of the star formation especially in young, &quot;starburst&quot; galaxies. In these galaxies, the dust has not yet had the time to disperse far from the compact sites of star formation.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;The dust begins to glow in long-wavelengths as it is heated by the stars. Although infrared light, which has long wavelengths, is invisible to the human eye, it may be detected by telescopes designed to observe these wavelengths.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Only the surface of the clouds can be seen for the most compact, dust-enshrouded starbursts. The starburst galaxies are invisible not only at the &quot;humans perceivable&quot;, optical wavelengths, but also in the beginning of the infrared spectrum. This is utterly dark even to the Hubble Space Telescope.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Seeing Galaxies In Longer Wavelengths&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Astronomers at the Cosmic Dawn Center decided to take a look at the early universe at even longer wavelengths. They used the radio/microwave antennae at two of the world's largest radio observatories. These are the Atacama Large Millimeter Array (ALMA) in Chile, and the Northern Extended Millimeter Array (NOEMA) in France.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Shuowen Jin, a researcher at the Cosmic Dawn Center, found a population of compact starburst galaxies, cloaked in extremely thick dust clouds, with the help of observations of the same field on the sky acquired with other radio telescopes.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Looking Through The Clouds&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Astronomers were able to measure the star formation rate and the temperature of the dust with the help of the radio- and microwave observations.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;In a statement released by Niels Bohr Institute, Shuowen Jin said that in these epochs, one to two billion years after the Big Bang, galaxies like these contributed significantly to the total star formation rate of the universe, but pass unnoticed in optical and near-infrared observations.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;The study has explained why these galaxies are so dark in optical and infrared. Shuowen Jin explained that because the dust clouds are so thick and dense, optical and near-infrared light cannot travel through.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Jin added that even the far-infrared light is partially absorbed.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Not only dust, but also monoxide molecules mixed within the clouds. The light emitted by the carbon monoxide molecules can help astronomers probe an important quantity of galaxies &amp;mdash; the mass of all the gas in the galaxy.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;", "link": "https://news.abplive.com/science/what-radio-waves-and-microwaves-tell-us-about-dark-galaxies-in-early-universe-1542941", "published_js": "2022-07-17", "author": "Radifah Kabir"}, {"title": "First Ever Exoplanets Discovered 30 Years Ago May Be 'Extraordinarily' Rare, Astronomers Reveal", "summary": "&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Astronomers discovered the first ever exoplanets 30 years ago around a rapidly rotating star, called a pulsar.

According to the Royal Astronomical Society, the extremely violent conditions surrounding the births and lives of pulsars make 'normal' planet formation unlikely, and many of these detected planets are exotic objects. For instance, there are some planets made mostly of diamonds. These planets are likely those known in our solar system.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Formation Of Pulsar-Planet Systems Different From Traditional Star-Planet Systems&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Astronomers at the University of Manchester performed the largest search for planets orbiting pulsars to date, looking for signals that indicate the presence of planetary companions with masses up to 100 times that of the Earth, and orbital time periods between 20 days and 17 years. The astronomers detected 10 potential candidates. The most promising candidate is the system PSR J2007+3120.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;According to the Royal Astronomical Society, the planet has the possibility of hosting at least two planets, with masses a few times bigger than the Earth, and orbital periods between 1.9 and 3.6 years.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;The results present information on the shape of the orbits of these planets. In contrast to the near-circular orbits found in the solar system, the planets would orbit their stars on highly elliptical paths, indicating that the formation process for pulsar-planet systems is vastly different from traditional star-planet systems.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;", "link": "https://news.abplive.com/science/first-ever-exoplanets-discovered-30-years-ago-may-be-extraordinarily-rare-astronomers-reveal-1542923", "published_js": "2022-07-17", "author": "Radifah Kabir"}, {"title": "NASA, Roscosmos Sign Agreement To Integrate Flights To Space Station: Report", "summary": "&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;NASA and the Russian space agency, Roscosmos, have signed an agreement to integrate flights to the International Space Station (ISS).

The exact mechanism for signalling has previously eluded researchers, according to Professor Sheng Luan, chair of the PMB department and senior author on the paper.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;In a statement released by University of California Berkeley, he said at the moment, this whole process is now more clear than ever before.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Plants Send Each Other Molecular 'Love Notes'&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Sexual reproduction in flowers occurs through pollination, a process that involves the transfer of pollen from a flower's stamen, the male fertilising organ, to the stigma on the pistil, the female reproductive organ. After the pollen grain lands on the stigma, a pollen tube grows from the pollen grain to an ovule to facilitate the transfer of the sperm to the egg.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;According to the statement, Luan said researchers have previously recorded the presence of calcium waves preceding the fertilisation process. He noted that &quot;they knew the calcium signal is important but didn't know exactly how it is produced&quot;.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;The researchers introduced a biosensor to analyse how the calcium wave was produced by the female cell. The biosensor reports calcium levels in the specific cell to look for signals from the male parts that trigger calcium waves.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Luan and his colleagues found that pollen tubes emit several small peptides that can be recognised by peptide receptors on the surface of the female cell. Peptides are short chains of amino acids. Once activated, peptide receptors recruit a calcium channel that guides the pollen tube to the ovule and initiates fertilisation, the study said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Luan explained that one could compare this to a delivery service. This is because the small peptide molecule serves as a signal to the female part of the flower, like a knock on the door letting the female part know the pollen tube is here.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;After this the calcium waves cause the pollen tube to rupture. The immobile sperm is released once it is inside the ovule. This ensures a successful fertilisation process.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Luan said that in a way, the pollen tube basically commits suicide to release the sperm. He added that sometimes, the female reproductive cell also dies in order to expose the egg so they can meet and produce new life.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;&quot;It's kind of a romantic journey for plant reproduction,&quot; Luan said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe title=&quot;YouTube video player&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/1cg0tArBhsk&quot; width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;allowfullscreen&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ALSO READ |&lt;a title=&quot; Researchers Find 2000-Year-Old Pregnant Mummy That May Have Had Cancer&quot; href=&quot;https://news.abplive.com/science/researchers-find-2000-year-old-pregnant-mummy-that-may-have-had-cancer-1542906&quot; target=&quot;&quot;&gt; Researchers Find 2000-Year-Old Pregnant Mummy That May Have Had Cancer&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Plants' Miraculous Ability To Communicate Via Molecular Emissions&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Understanding the intricate molecular processes of fertilisation may help improve the commercial yields in flowering plants, according to Luan.
