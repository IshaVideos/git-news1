The other cases reported include the Western Pacific Region (70 cases), Southeast Asia (19) and the Eastern Mediterranean (two cases).&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Around 17 nations have reported more than five probable cases, but the actual number of cases may be underestimated, in part owing to the limited enhanced surveillance systems in place, said WHO.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Going by the UN health agency's latest assessment, the risk of this paediatric hepatitis outbreak spreading is &amp;lsquo;moderate&amp;rsquo;.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What are the symptoms?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Based on 100 probable cases with available clinical data, the most commonly reported symptoms are nausea or vomiting (in 60 per cent of cases), jaundice (53 per cent), general weakness (52 per cent) and abdominal pain (50 per cent).&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The average gap between the onset of symptoms and hospitalisation is seen as four days.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is the infection detected?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The laboratory tests didn&amp;rsquo;t show the presence of hepatitis A to E in affected children. Other pathogens such as the coronavirus were detected in a number of cases, but the data is incomplete, the UN health agency noted.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;It noted that Adenoviruses, reason behind a wide range of illnesses, such as cold, fever, sore throat and pneumonia, have remained &quot;the most frequently detected pathogen&quot; in cases of paediatric hepatitis, WHO said.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;In Europe, adenovirus was detected by polymerase chain reaction tests (PCR) in 52 per cent of the child hepatitis cases (193/368) so far. In Japan, it was found in just nine per cent of cases (5/58).&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;According to UN News, owing to limited adenovirus surveillance in most countries, it is quite possible that the true number of cases of child hepatitis is higher than currently known.&lt;/p&gt;", "link": "https://news.abplive.com/news/world/mystery-child-hepatitis-outbreak-surpasses-1-000-cases-in-35-countries-who-1542445", "published_js": "2022-07-14", "author": "ABP News Bureau"}, {"title": "WATCH | Sri Lanka Military Personnel Guard PM's Chair From Protesters", "summary": "&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Several protesters Wednesday stormed the Prime Minister&amp;rsquo;s office at Flower Road in the capital city Colombo after the country&amp;rsquo;s embattled President Gotabaya Rajapaksa fled the country.

This is an image of the galaxy cluster SMACS 0723, and is &quot;overflowing with detail&quot;, according to the European Space Agency. The galaxy cluster is present near the constellation Volans in the southern sky.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Thousands of galaxies and the faintest objects ever observed in infrared light have appeared in Webb's view.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;The image has been captured by Webb's Near-Infrared Camera (NIRCam), and is a composite made from images at different wavelengths, totalling 12.5 hours. According to NASA, the combined mass of the galaxy cluster SMACS 0723 acts as a gravitational lens, magnifying more distant galaxies. The powerful gravitational field of the galaxy cluster bent the light rays from the distant galaxies behind it, similar to a magnifying glass.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Some of the galaxies are from the early universe, when the universe was less than a billion years old.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Webb's First Deep Field shows the galaxy cluster SMACS 0723 as it appeared 4.6 billion years ago. The NIRCam instrument has brought distant galaxies into sharp focus. These galaxies have tiny, faint structures that have never been seen before, including star clusters and diffuse features.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;It took billions of years for the light from these galaxies to reach us. When viewing the youngest galaxies in Webb's First Deep Field, we are looking back in time to a few 100 million years after the Big Bang. Due to the expansion of the universe, the light was stretched to infrared wavelengths that Webb was designed to observe.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Webb has also captured stars, which appear brighter at shorter wavelengths.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;The galaxy cluster has also been captured by Webb's Mid-Infrared Instrument (MIRI). The MIRI image offers a kaleidoscope of colours and highlights where the dust is present. Dust is a major ingredient for star formation, and ultimately for life.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Blue stars contain stars, but very little dust, while red objects are made up of thick layers of dust.

The exoplanet is a type of gas giant without any direct analogue in the solar system, and has a mass less than half that of Jupiter, and a diameter 1.2 times greater.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;With a temperature greater than 1000 degrees Fahrenheit, WASP-96 b is significantly hotter, and orbits extremely close to its Sun-like star, at just one-ninth the distance between Mercury and the Sun.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;The exoplanet is an ideal target for atmospheric observations because of the combination of large size, short orbital period, puffy atmosphere, and lack of contaminating light from objects nearby in the sky.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;On June 21, Webb's NIRISS measured light from the WASP-96 b system for 6.4 hours as the planet moved across the star, and as a result, a light curve and a transmission spectrum were obtained. As the exoplanet transits the star's disc, its light dims.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;The light curve confirms properties of the exoplanet that had previously been determined from other observations, and the transmission spectrum reveals previously hidden details of the atmosphere, including the unambiguous signature of water, indications of haze, and evidence of clouds that were not thought to exist.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;By comparing the starlight filtered through a planet's atmosphere as it moves across the star to the unfiltered starlight detected when the planet is beside the star, researchers made a transmission spectrum. The NIRISS is the most detailed exoplanet spectrum to date.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;According to NASA, the spectrum will help researchers measure the amount of water vapour in the atmosphere, determine the abundance of various elements like carbon and oxygen, and estimate the temperature of the atmosphere with depth. Using this information, researchers can determine the overall make-up of the planet, and know how, when, and where it formed.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Webb's 270-square-foot gold-coated mirror collects infrared light efficiently.

The nebula is approximately 2,500 light years away from Earth.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;According to NASA, planetary nebulae are the shells of gas and dust ejected from dying stars.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Through its third full-colour image, Webb has revealed details of the Southern Ring planetary nebula that were previously hidden from astronomers. Shells of gas and dust ejected from dying stars constitute planetary nebulae.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;The powerful infrared view of Webb has brought the nebula's second star into full view, along with exceptional structures created as the stars shape the gas and dust around them.

The image has captured the &quot;final performance&quot; of a dying star in fine detail.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;A cache of distant galaxies can also be seen in the background. Most of the multi-coloured points seen in the image are galaxies, not stars.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;The Southern Ring planetary nebula has been imaged using the Near-Infrared Camera (NIRCam) and the Mid Infra-Red Instrument (MIRI).&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Two stars, locked in a tight orbit, shape the local landscape of the cosmic entity. The image from Webb's NIRCam (left) shows the stars and their layers of light. Meanwhile, the image from Webb's MIRI (right) shows for the first time that the second star is surrounded by dust.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Hundreds of stars and background galaxies are seen in the near-infrared image, while dusty planet-forming disks around young stars are seen in the mid-infrared image.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;According to NASA, the brighter star, which is in an earlier stage of its evolution, will probably eject its own planetary nebula in the future.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;The brighter star influences the appearance of the nebula. As the two stars orbit one another, they &quot;stir the pot&quot; of gas and dust. This causes asymmetrical patterns.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;The dimmer star seen at the centre of the nebula has been sending out rings of gas and dust for thousands of years in all directions, and Webb has revealed for the first time that the star is cloaked in dust.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;According to NASA, each shell of gas represents an episode where the fainter star lost some of its mass. The widest shells of gas, seen toward the outer areas of the nebula, were ejected earlier. The shells of gas closest to the star and the most recent. By tracing these elections, researchers can look into the history of the system.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;NIRCam has also made observations which reveal extremely fine rays of light around the planetary nebula. There are holes in the gas and dust from which starlight streams out.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;According to NASA, observing a nebula is like watching a movie in exceptionally slow motion because planetary nebulae exist for tens of thousands of years. The shells of gas puffed by the star give researchers the ability to precisely measure the gas and dust present in the planetary nebula.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Dust and molecules form within the shells of material ejected by the star. This changes the landscape even as the star continues to expel material. The dust eventually enriches the areas around it, and expands into the Interstellar medium. The dust is very long-lived, because of which it may end up travelling through space for billions of years and become incorporated into a new star or planet.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;The delicate layers of gas and dust seen in the Southern Planetary Nebula will dissipate into surrounding space in thousands of years.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stephan's Quintet: Webb Captures Dancing Galaxies&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;figure class=&quot;image&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://feeds.abplive.com/onecms/images/uploaded-images/2022/07/14/9bb74f8e75528ef78a4840046fa47a991657789929_original.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Stephan's Quintet&quot; /&gt;\n&lt;figcaption&gt;Stephan's Quintet&lt;/figcaption&gt;\n&lt;/figure&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;The fourth full-colour image is that of a galaxy group called &quot;Stephan's Quintet&quot;.

Also, tight galaxy groups like Stephan's Quintet are likely to have been more common in the early universe.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;The enormous mosaic of Stephan's Quintet is the largest image to date from the Webb Space Telescope. It contains over 150 million pixels and is constructed from almost 1,000 separate image files, and provides new insights into how galactic interactions may have driven galactic evolution in the early universe.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;The MIRI and NIRCam instruments captured the visual grouping of the five galaxies of Stephan's Quintet. Together, the galaxies are also known as the Hickson Compact Group 92.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;The galaxies in Stephan's Quintet are in a galactic dance with each other. The image sheds light into galaxy evolutions and black holes.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Webb's picture shows sparkling clusters of millions of young stars and starburst regions of fresh star birth.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Due to gravitational interventions, sweeping tails of gas, dust and stars are being pulled from several of the galaxies. Webb has captured huge shock waves as one of the galaxies, NGC 7318B, smashed through the cluster.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Only four of the galaxies in Stephan's Quintet are truly close together and caught in a cosmic dance. NGC 7320, the fifth and leftmost galaxy, is in the foreground, compared with the other four. The galaxy is present 40 million light-years away from Earth. Meanwhile, the other four galaxies &amp;mdash; NGC 7317, NGC 7318A, NGC 7318B, and NGC 7319 &amp;mdash; are about 290 million light-years away from Earth.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;According to NASA, this distance is fairly close in cosmic terms, compared with more distant galaxies billions of light-years away. Scientists can better understand structures seen in a much more distant universe by studying such relatively nearby galaxies.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Scientists rarely get the opportunity to see in detail how interacting galaxies trigger star formation in each other, and how the gas in these galaxies is being disturbed. According to NASA, Stephan's Quintet is a fantastic &quot;laboratory&quot; for studying these processes fundamental to all galaxies.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;NGC 7319, the topmost galaxy in the group, harbours an active galactic nucleus, which is a supermassive black hole 24 million times the mass of the Sun. The active galactic nucleus is actively pulling in material and puts out light energy equivalent to 40 billion Suns.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Using the Near-Infrared Spectrograph (NIRSpec) and MIRI, Webb has studied the active galactic nucleus in great detail. The instruments helped the Webb team obtain a collection of images of the galactic core's spectral features.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;The telescope pierced through the shroud of dust surrounding the nucleus to reveal hot gas near the active black hole and measure the velocity of bright outflows, and saw the outflows driven by the black hole in unprecedented detail.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Webb was able to resolve individual stars in NGC 7320 and also the galaxy's bright core.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;The JWST revealed a vast sea of thousands of distant background galaxies as a bonus.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;The most detailed image of the Stephan's Quintet, along with Webb data, will help scientists understand the rate at which supermassive black holes feed and grow, and to see star-forming regions more directly.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cosmic Cliffs: Glittering Landscape Of Starbirth&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;figure class=&quot;image&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://feeds.abplive.com/onecms/images/uploaded-images/2022/07/14/f12ed24ae5b540b847421c20acc465b01657790027_original.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Cosmic Cliffs in Carina Nebula&quot; /&gt;\n&lt;figcaption&gt;Cosmic Cliffs in Carina Nebula&lt;/figcaption&gt;\n&lt;/figure&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;The fifth and final full-colour image captured by the James Webb Space Telescope is that of the Carina Nebula. The image reveals baby stars in the Carina Nebula, where ultraviolet radiation and stellar winds shape colossal walls of dust and gas.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Webb's fifth and final full-colour image reveals emerging stellar nurseries and individual stars in the Carina Nebula.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;The image is called &quot;Cosmic Cliffs&quot;, and is a seemingly three-dimensional picture. A landscape of &quot;mountains&quot; and &quot;valleys&quot; speckled with glittering stars can be seen in the image.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;The landscape is the edge of a nearby, young star-forming region called NGC 3324 in the Carina Nebula. Webb has captured the image in infrared light.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;&amp;ldquo;Cosmic Cliffs&amp;rdquo; reveals for the first time previously invisible areas of star birth. The image reveals the &quot;glittering landscape&quot; of star birth.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Webb's extreme sensitivity, spatial resolution, and imaging capability helped capture the cosmic objects in the earliest, rapid phases of star formation.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;NGC 3324 is located roughly 7,600 light-years away from Earth. Webb's NIRCam and MIRI captured the star-forming region. The tallest peaks seen in the image are about seven light-years high.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Due to intense ultraviolet radiation and stellar winds from extremely massive, hot, young stars, a cavernous area has been carved from the nebula. The young stars are located in the centre of the bubble. The stars can be seen in the top of the image.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Webb's NIRCam instrument has unveiled hundreds of previously hidden stars, and even numerous background galaxies.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;MIRI has revealed the structures that are embedded in the dust and uncovered the stellar sources of massive outflows.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;According to NASA, the blistering, ultraviolet radiation from the young stars is sculpting the Carina nebula's wall by slowly eroding it away. Pillars resisting this radiation tower above the glowing wall of gas.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;A &quot;steam&quot; appears to rise from the celestial &quot;mountains&quot;. The steam is actually hot, ionised gas and hot dust streaming away from the nebula due to the blistering ultraviolet radiation.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Through its infrared vision, Webb reveals emerging stellar nurseries and individual stars that are completely hidden in visible-light pictures. Webb can peer through cosmic dust to see objects because of its sensitivity to infrared light.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Protostellar jets, which are intriguing signspots of star formation, can be seen in the image. These jets shoot out from some of the young stars.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;The youngest stars appear as red spots in the dark, dusty region of the cloud, according to NASA.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Webb's observations of NGC 3324 will shed light on the process of star formation. The birth of a star propagates over time, and is triggered by the expansion of the eroding cavity.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;The bright, ionised rim moves into the nebula, and slowly pushes into the gas and dust.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;The pressure in the rim may increase if it encounters any unstable material. This will trigger the material to collapse and form new stars.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;However, the same disturbance may prevent star formation. This is because the star-forming material is eroding away. According to NASA, this is a very delicate balance between sparking star formation and stopping it. Some of the questions of modern astrophysics which Webb will answer include what determines the number of stars forming in a certain region and why stars form with a certain mass.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Other information which Webb will unveil include the impact of star formation on the evolution of gigantic clouds of gas and dust. Low-mass stars create narrow, opposing jets as they form. This injects a lot of momentum and energy into the clouds of gas and dust, reducing the fraction of nebular material that seeds new stars.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Webb's NIRCam, which has crisp resolution and unparalleled sensitivity, has unveiled hundreds of previously hidden stars, and numerous background galaxies.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Young stars and their dusty planet-forming disks have appeared in MIRI's view. These discs shine brightly in the mid-infrared, and appear pink and red. MIRI has revealed structures embedded in the dust, and has uncovered the stellar sources of massive jets and outflows.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Scottish astronomer James Dunlop was the first to catalogue NGC 3324. The star-forming region is located at the northwest corner of the Carina Nebula, which resides in the constellation Carina.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;The Keyhole Nebula, and the active, unstable supergiant star called Eta Carinae are also present in the Carina Nebula.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jupiter, Its Moons, And Ring&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;figure class=&quot;image&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://feeds.abplive.com/onecms/images/uploaded-images/2022/07/14/5f174b87a88ed7f940206fa58188c00f1657790108_original.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Webb's images of Jupiter&quot; /&gt;\n&lt;figcaption&gt;Webb's images of Jupiter&lt;/figcaption&gt;\n&lt;/figure&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Webb has tracked solar system objects at speeds more than twice the requirement.
