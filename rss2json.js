Adolescent Health journal on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The largest study to date of long COVID symptoms in children aged 0-14 years used national level sampling of children in Denmark and matched COVID-19 positive cases with a control group with no prior history of a the disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &quot;The overall aim of our study was to determine the prevalence of long-lasting symptoms in children and infants, alongside quality of life, and absence from school or day care,&quot; said Professor Selina Kikkenborg Berg, from Copenhagen University Hospital, Denmark \t &quot;Our results reveal that, although children with a positive COVID-19 diagnosis are more likely to experience long-lasting symptoms than children with no previous COVID-19 diagnosis, the pandemic has affected every aspect of all young people's lives,&quot; Berg said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Further research into the long-term consequences of the pandemic on all children will be important going forwards, the researcher said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Most previous studies of long COVID in young people have focussed on adolescents, with infants and toddlers seldom represented.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In the study, surveys were sent to the mother or guardian of children between 0-14 years who had tested positive for COVID-19 between January 2020 and July 2021.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In total, responses were received for almost 11,000 children with a positive COVID-19 test result who were matched by age and sex to over 33,000 children who had never tested positive for COVID-19.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The surveys asked participants about the 23 most common symptoms of long COVID in children and used the World Health Organization definition of long COVID as symptoms lasting more than two months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The most commonly reported symptoms among children 0-3 years old were mood swings, rashes, and stomach aches.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Among 4-11 years old the most commonly reported symptoms were mood swings, trouble remembering or concentrating, and rashes, and among 12-14 years old, fatigue, mood swings, and trouble remembering or concentrating.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The results of the study found children diagnosed with COVID-19 in all age groups to be more likely to experience at least one symptom for two months or longer than the control group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In the 0-3 years age group 40 per cent of children diagnosed with COVID-19 (478 of 1,194 children) experienced symptoms for longer than two months, compared to 27 per cent of controls (1,049 of 3,855 children).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; For the 4-11 years age group the ratio was 38 per cent of cases (1,912 of 5,023 children) compared to 34 per cent of controls (6,189 of 18,372 children), and for the 12-14 years age group, 46 per cent of cases (1,313 of 2,857 children) compared to 41 per cent of controls (4,454 of 10,789 children) experienced long-lasting symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The types of non-specific symptoms associated with long COVID are often experienced by otherwise healthy children; headache, mood swings, abdominal pain, and fatigue are all symptoms of common ailments that children experience which are unrelated to COVID-19.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; However, the study revealed that children with a positive COVID-19 diagnosis were more likely to experience long-lasting symptoms than children who had never had a positive diagnosis, suggesting that these symptoms were a presentation of long COVID.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; This is supported by approximately one third of children with positive COVID-19 tests experiencing symptoms that were not present before the SARS-CoV-2 infection, the researchers said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In addition, with increasing duration of symptoms, the proportion of children with those symptoms tended to decrease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Generally, children diagnosed with COVID-19 reported less psychological and social problems than children in the control group, they said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In older age groups, cases often felt less scared, had less trouble sleeping, and felt less worried about what would happen to them, according to the researchers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A likely explanation for this is the increased pandemic awareness in older age groups, with children in the control group experiencing fear of the unknown disease and more restricted everyday life due to protecting themselves from catching the virus, they added.

There is also a severe lack of systematic waste management and infrastructure to make it sustainable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; \u201cAmritsar has over 1,00,000 visitors and pilgrims coming to the city on a daily basis and the impact can be seen in the surrounding environment, from the strain on water and food resources to the extra energy used and the additional waste and litter created.

It had lobbied SGPC to make the Darbar Sahib langar go organic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; EcoSikh was founded in 2009 in collaboration with the United Nations Development Program.

Key fundamentals under play are: current geo-political situation, innovation driven mindset of India\u2019s top leadership, and momentum in the western world for diversity, inclusiveness and equity in clinical trials,\u201d said Karun Rishi, president of USA-India Chamber of Commerce.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Being held virtually, like the previous two years, USAICC said the 16th annual BioPharma &amp; Healthcare Summit is being attended by several thousand from across the world. Indian government and industry leaders participating are Dr Vinod Paul, Member, NITI Aayog, Hari Bhartia, Kiran Mazumdar Shaw, Naresh Trehan, and Shiv Sarin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; There is a strong participation from the US government. Lawrence Tabak, Acting Director, National Institutes of Health (NIH) and Max Bronstein, Assistant Director for Health Innovation in the White House Office of Science &amp; Technology Policy (OSTP) are confirmed so are the past NIH Director Elias Zerhouni and the former US CDC Director Julie Gerberding.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Participation of Johnson &amp; Johnson\u2019s Executive Chairman Alex Gorsky, Biogen\u2019s Chairman Stelios Papadopoulos along with top venture capitalists, academic leaders from the Harvard, MIT and global Research and Development heads of Janssen, Takeda, Sanofi, Amgen, Bayer, UCB and several other leading companies demonstrates the interest of global biopharma companies to collaborate with India, USAICC said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Over the past few years, positive regulatory policies have been framed. Still, the global clinical trials being done in India are a very small percentage of overall global trials. This does not reflect India\u2019s true potential, Rishi said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; \u201cRobust clinical trials infrastructure and pragmatic regulatory policies are key for global clinical trials to come to India on a large scale. This will pave way for collaborations, investments, startups, employment generation of high paying jobs and GDP growth. Entire innovation ecosystem will be created in India,\u201d he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Rishi said developing and nurturing the next generation of innovative leaders in biopharma is fundamental to India becoming an innovation nation and source of innovation for accelerating discovery, development and manufacture novel therapeutics for India and for the rest of the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; \u201cThis is achievable. Political will is there. We need to work together for the common goal- patients. Global biopharma industry and the Indian government need to collaborate, communicate and remove trust deficit for the sake of patients,\u201d Rishi said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Andrew Plump, president of R&amp;D, Takeda Pharmaceuticals said this year\u2019s 16th Annual USAIC BioPharma &amp; Healthcare Summit will convene and engage leaders to share their insights on critical topics driving the biopharma ecosystem.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; \u201cThis year we are introducing a special panel focused on the clinical trial landscape in India, and we hope to identify opportunities where USAIC can collaborate with key stakeholders in India to promote clinical trial infrastructure, incentivise multinational biopharmaceutical companies to conduct trials, and ultimately enhance Indian patients\u2019 access to innovative medicines,\u201d he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Kiran Mazumdar Shaw, executive chairperson, Biocon Group and USAIC advisory Board member said that India\u2019s innovation ecosystem is developing rapidly on a platform of technology convergence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &quot;India\u2019s IT prowess has catalysed a Digital focus on biopharma innovation that is generating AI-powered diagnostics, Digital Health management and software for drug discovery,\u201d she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &quot;Handheld breast mammograms, AI powered CT-scans with instant readouts and rapid tests for viral and bacterial infections are some of the examples. Cell and gene therapies are also seeing rapid development with at least 3 start-ups with CAR-Ts in the clinic,\u201d she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; \u201cThe pandemic has revitalized the clinical research eco-system and the decade ahead will see India\u2019s biopharma space investing exponentially in discovery led innovation. USAIC\u2019s tireless efforts of driving India\u2019s innovation efforts over the last 16 years are finally being realized, \u201d said Shaw.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; \u201cInnovation in the biopharma industry continues to be fueled by scientific and technological advancements. The COVID-19 pandemic further expedited digitalization, transforming drug research &amp; development. Today several clinical trials are held virtually, with on-site visits limited to high-risk interventions and invasive monitoring,\u201d said Hari Bhartia, founder &amp; co-chairman, Jubilant Bhartia Group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Indian industry is also witnessing sweeping changes with massive investments by companies in scientific innovation like cell/gene therapies, integrated drug discovery models, mRNA-based vaccines etc, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\u201cThis is further amplified by digital innovations like AI-backed drug research and digital clinical trials management assets. Despite regulatory and legal challenges, India has the potential to become one of the largest clinical trial markets globally. Its strong medical infrastructure, IPR protection, patient availability, experienced talent and cost competitiveness will act as key differentiators,\u201d Bhartia said.

The additional tax measures will be announced in the final budget speech by the finance minister.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Although the government shied away from unpopular tax measures for fear of political backlash in its first budget and pinned its hopes on achieving maximum revenue from higher than expected inflation and economic growth, the low revenue target did not go down well with the IMF, which asked Islamabad to take additional measures to make the revenue collection target more realistic.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The Fund&amp;rsquo;s preliminary estimates that additional measures will be needed were conveyed to the finance ministry soon after the announcement of the budget.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;As part of the deal, the government also agreed to do away with provisions for additional salaries and pensions, for which Rs 20,000 crore had been set aside as block allocation. Instead, a separate allocation of contingencies had been made but that would be strictly meant for emergencies like floods and earthquakes so that amount remains unspent.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Pakistan also committed to deliver a Rs 15,200 crore primary budget surplus, which means the revenues would finance all expenditures - other than interest payments - and still leave a Rs 15,200 cr surplus in the national kitty.
