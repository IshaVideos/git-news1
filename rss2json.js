The trial participants were administered an experimental medicine combined with Atezolizumab, an immunotherapy drug. Atezolizumab was administered to the participants intravenously. David continues to have the drug every three weeks.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;David Had Horrible Side Effects At First&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Quoting David, the PTI report said that she was 15 months down the line after her initial cancer treatment and had almost forgotten about it, but then the cancer returned.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;David said when she was offered the trial, she did not know if it would work for her. However, she thought that at least she could do something to help others and use her body for the next generation.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;David added that at first, she had many horrible side effects including headaches and spiking temperatures, so she was in hospital over Christmas and quite poorly. &quot;Then thankfully, I started to respond well to the treatment,&quot; she further said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cancer Treatment Before The NHS Trial&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Earlier, David, a mother of two grown-up children, worked as a clinical lead at a care home for the elderly. In November 2017, she discovered an aggressive triple negative form of breast cancer.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;After undergoing six months of chemotherapy and a mastectomy in April 2018, adavis went through 15 cycles of radiotherapy. This cleared her body of cancer.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;However, in October 2019, the cancer returned, and her scans showed multiple lesions throughout her body, implying she had a poor prognosis.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;According to the report, the cancer had spread to the lungs, lymph nodes and chest bones. David was told that she had less than a year to live. Then, David was offered the opportunity to be part of research by participating in a Phase I clinical trial.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;David Deemed Cancer-Free By June 2021&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;David said she celebrated her 50th birthday in February 2020 while still in the middle of treatment and not knowing what the future held. &quot;Two and a half years ago I thought it was the end and now I feel like I've been reborn,&quot; she said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;David stated that there is a change in her life after returning to India to see family in April and she has decided to take early retirement and live her life in gratitude to God and medical science. She added that her family has been supportive of this decision, and that she will be celebrating her 25th wedding anniversary in September.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;No measurable cancer cells in her body were seen in her scans. She was deemed cancer-free by June 2021. Though she continues to show no evidence of the disease, she will remain on treatment until December 2023.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;&quot;We are really pleased that Jasmin has such a good outcome. At The Christie, we are continually testing new drugs and therapies to see if they can benefit more people,&quot; Professor Fiona Thistlethwaite, medical oncologist and clinical director of Manchester CRF at The Christie was quoted as saying in the report.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In June, Tumours Disappeared From Every Patient In Drug Trial&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;A similar wonder in the field of oncology occurred in the month of June. For the first time in the history of cancer, tumours had disappeared from every patient involved in a drug trial. As many as 18 rectal cancer patients participated in the trial, and each of them was given the same drug.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Surprisingly, the cancer had vanished and every single patient, and was undetectable by physical examination, endoscopy or Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) scans. The study describing the results was published in the New England Journal of Medicine.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;According to a report published by The New York Times (NYT), Dr Luis A. Diaz Jr of Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center said he knew of no other study in which a treatment completely obliterated a cancer in every patient.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;He said he believes this is the first time this has happened in the history of cancer.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;The study found that on average, one in five patients have some sort of adverse reaction to dostarlimab, the drug the patients took. Dostarlimab is also known as a checkpoint inhibitor. The medication, which was given every three weeks for six months, unmasks cancer cells, allowing the immune system to identify and destroy them, and costs about $11,000 per dose.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Most adverse reactions are easily managed, the report said. However, as many as three to five per cent of patients who take checkpoint inhibitors have more severe complications. In some cases, these complications can result in muscle weakness and difficulty swallowing and chewing.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;", "link": "https://news.abplive.com/health/indian-origin-woman-cancer-free-after-successful-2-year-trial-in-uk-nhs-names-drug-atezolizumab-national-institute-for-health-and-care-research-nihr-manchester-clinical-research-facility-crf-at-christie-nhs-foundation-trust-1540885", "published_js": "2022-07-05", "author": "ABP News Bureau"}, {"title": "'Biggest Drama In Pakistan History': Maryam Nawaz On Imran Khan's Foreign Conspiracy Claim", "summary": "&lt;p&gt;Hitting out at the former Pakistan prime minister Imran Khan, Pakistan Muslim League (N) Vice-President Maryam Nawaz on Monday said the former PM staged &quot;the biggest drama in the history of Pakistan&quot; under the name of a foreign conspiracy, reported news agency ANI.

The LHC will work continuously for four years at a record energy of 13.6 trillion electron volts (TeV), and will provide greater precision and discovery potential than ever before.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The New LHC Run Will Pave The Way For New Discoveries&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;In a statement released by CERN, Director for Accelerators and Technology Mike Lamont said the proton beams will be focused at the interaction points to less than 10 micron beam size, in order to increase the collision rate. The Higgs boson was discovered as part of LHC Run 1. It delivered 12 inverse femtobarns, which are a measurement of particle collisions per femtobarn. A femtobarn is 10^-39 square centimetres, an incomprehensibly small unit of area.

The measurement precision of numerous known processes will be improved because previously inaccessible processes can be observed.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;LHC Run 3 Expected To Reveal Mysteries Such As Matter-Antimatter Symmetry&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;This will help address fundamental questions such as the origin of matter-antimatter asymmetry in the universe. The Big Bang must have created equal amounts of matter and antimatter in the early universe; yet, all biotic and abiotic objects on Earth, and the largest stellar objects are made almost entirely of matter. Not much antimatter is found relative to the amount of matter present in the universe. Some events must have tipped the balance. This asymmetry between matter and antimatter is known as matter-antimatter asymmetry, and one of the biggest challenges in physics is to figure out what happened to the antimatter. Run 3 of the LHC is expected to answer this question.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Properties of matter under extreme temperature and density will be studied. Scientists will also search for candidates for dark matter and for other new phenomena either directly or indirectly, through precise measurements of properties of known particles.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CERN Will Measure Higgs Boson Decay To Second-Generation Particles&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;CERN theorist Michelangelo Mangano said people at CERN are looking forward to measurements of the Higgs Boson decay to second-generation particles such as muons, which would be an entirely new result in the Higgs boson saga, confirming for the first time that the second-generation particles also get mass through the Higgs mechanism.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;According to physics, space is filled with many invisible fields, such as gravitational field, electromagnetic field etc. One of these is known as the Higgs field, and was proposed by Francois Englert, Robert Brout and Peter Higgs. All particles acquire mass only if they come into contact with the Higgs field. If the Higgs field disappeared, all matter would cease to exist.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;The Higgs particle is a vibration of the Higgs field. According to the official website of the Nobel Prize organisation, the Higgs mechanism, that explains how &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;particles acquire mass, is what managed to rescue the Standard Model.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CERN Will Also Search For Additional Higgs Bosons&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Andreas Hoecker, spokesperson of the ATLAS collaboration, said the strengths of the Higgs boson interactions with matter and force particles will be measured to unprecedented precision. People at CERN will also further their searches for Higgs boson decays to dark matter particles as well as searches for additional Higgs bosons.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Hoecker said it is not at all clear whether the Higgs mechanism realised in nature is the minimal one featuring only a single Higgs particle.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Other Interesting Findings Likely To Be Made&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Using data from previous LHC runs, the LHCb experiment had studied a class of rare processes in which an unexpected difference between electrons and their cousin particles, muons, was observed. The third run of the LHC will further study these rare processes.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Chris Parkes, spokesperson of the LHCb collaboration, said data acquired during Run 3 with CERN's brand new detector will allow the precision to be improved by a factor of two. The studies performed by ATLAS and CMS will aim to understand new effects in different processes predicted by LHCb.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Luca Malgeri, spokesperson of the CMS collaboration, said this complementary approach is essential because if they are able to confirm new effects in this way, it will be a major discovery in particle physics.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Investigating The Quark-Gluon Plasma&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;The quark-gluon plasma (QGP) is a state of matter that existed in the first 10 microseconds after the Big Bang.

All matter consists of particles, which are the building blocks of nature, and are governed by four types of forces &amp;mdash; gravitation, electromagnetism, the weak force and the strong force. The Standard Model unites the building blocks of nature and three of these four forces. Gravitation remains outside the Standard Model of particle physics.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;The Higgs boson must exist for the Standard Model to be correct.

However, his disabilities required that he is under supervision and his family had not wanted to miss the event.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;At least one of those killed was a Mexican national, a senior Mexican Foreign Ministry official said on Twitter.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;In an online poster of Crimo shared by the Lake County Sheriff's Office, the suspect is seen as a thin-faced bearded man with tattoos on face and neck. It said he weighed 120 pounds (54 kg) and was 5 feet 11 inches (1 meter 80 cms) tall.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The suspect appears to have published several self-made rap songs using the artist stage name &quot;Awake The Rapper.&quot; A video by Awake The Rapper shows a drawing of a stick figure holding a rifle in front of an another figure spread on the ground.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;YouTube recently terminated an associated user account, after the police named Crimo.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The gunman reached the rooftop of the business from where he took shots with an alley ladder attached to the building that was not secure.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;President Joe Biden said he and his wife Jill were &quot;shocked by the senseless gun violence that has once again brought grief to an American community on this Independence Day.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Biden said he had &quot;surged federal law enforcement to assist in the urgent search for the shooter.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;In his statement, Biden referred to bipartisan gun-reform legislation he signed recently but said much more is needed to be done and added: &quot;I&amp;rsquo;m not going to give up fighting the epidemic of gun violence.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The Highland Park July 4 parade shooting comes after 19 school children and two teachers were killed in a shooting incident at a school in Uvalde, Texas last month.

'Type specimens', which are specimens of the original plant used to formally describe the species, are absent in global plant collections, which explains the poor characterisation of the species. The reason why type specimens are not found is that the giant waterlilies are difficult to collect in the wild.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Victoria amazonica&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt; was the first species to be named in the genus &lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Victoria&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;, in 1832.

Therefore, Lucy made several nocturnal vigils to the glasshouses to capture the flowers for drawing and painting.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;The first flowers of &lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Victoria boliviana&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt; opened on a stormy evening in July 2018. This is when Lucy shared Carlos's suspicion that the waterlily was unique. She decided to describe the differences using illustrations, and observed a similarity between the new plant and the one which Fitch drew from a specimen collected in Bolivia in 1845. This proved that both the plants are the same species. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Victoria boliviana&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt; was unknown as a new species to Flitch in 1847.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bolivian Specimen Of &lt;em&gt;Victoria boliviana&lt;/em&gt; Was Collected In 1988 &amp;ndash; But Was Not Known As A New Species&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Dr Stephan G Beck, a researcher of the National Herbarium of Bolivia, partnered with the Kew team to formally describe the new species, and collected the type specimen for the waterlily unknowingly in 1988, thinking it was &lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Victoria cruziana&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;.
