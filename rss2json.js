The diversity of culture, food, clothes, music and traditions makes our democracy vibrant. India has shown that democracy can deliver and has delivered.&quot; \tIn his monthly 'Mann Ki Baat' radio broadcast earlier in the day, Modi had targeted the Congress for imposing the Emergency, and asserted that it is difficult to find another example in the world where people defeated a &quot;dictatorial mindset&quot; through democratic means.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Addressing the Indian community members who had come to Munich after travelling long distances, Modi lauded the contribution of the diaspora in promoting India\u2019s success story and acting as brand ambassadors of India\u2019s success.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Prime Minister highlighted India's growth story and mentioned various initiatives undertaken by the government to further achieve the country\u2019s development agenda.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;In last century, Germany and other countries benefited from the 3rd Industrial Revolution. India was a slave back then that's why it couldn't leverage benefits.

Today every village in India is open defecation free, has electricity and 99% of the villages also have clean cooking fuel.

Every month, on an average, India makes over 500 railway coaches, provides 18 lakh households clean water, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;There was a time when India was nowhere in the race of startups. Today, we are the third largest startup ecosystem. Similarly, we used to import even the simplest phones, today, we are the second largest mobile phone manufacturer in the world,&quot; Modi said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Modi said that drone technology is being used which is unprecedented. In India\u2019s many places, fertilisers are being sprayed using drones, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He also said that India has started the Swamitwa Yojana under which land\u2019s mapping in Indian villages is being made through drones only.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;This list of achievements is very long. If I keep speaking, your dinner time will be over. When a country takes correct decisions with correct intentions on time, then it is destined for development,&quot; he said, amid chants of Modi-Modi from the crowd.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;In Information technology, digital technology, India is making its presence felt. Forty per cent digital transactions in the world are from India. India is making new records in data consumption. India is among the countries where data is cheapest,\u201d he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the 21st Century's new India, the fast way people adopt technology is exciting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Today's India has come out of the mentality of \u2018It happens, it runs like this\u2019. Today India takes a pledge to 'have to do', 'have to do' and 'have to do on time',\u201d he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;India now is ready, prompt for development, for its dreams. Today, India believes in itself and its capabilities.

This is proof that on one hand, our manufacturers are ready for new opportunities, while the world is also looking at us with hope and confidence,\u201d he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Modi said that climate change is just not a matter of government policies in India. &quot;The youth of India is investing in EVs and other similar pro-climate technologies.  Sustainable climate practices are becoming a part of the lives of ordinary people of India today,\u201d he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Today cleanliness is becoming a lifestyle in India. The people of India, the youth of India are considering it their duty to keep the country clean. Today the people of India are confident that their money is used honestly for the country, corruption is not getting paid. That's why tax compliance is increasing rapidly in the country,\u201d he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;We have brought 21st century policies for the youth of New India. Today, our youth will be able to complete their education in their own mother tongues,&quot; the prime minister said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Modi said that India is now no longer lamenting over global problems, instead India is leading the charge and providing sustainable solutions to the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Today, with the International Solar Alliance, India has given the mantra of 'One Sun, One World, One Grid' to the world,&quot; Modi added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;As we celebrate 75 years of Independence, India is now dreaming new dreams, making new goals and working towards realising them. India is moving from Sankalp to Samriddhi,&quot; he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Modi said that with initiatives such as the PLI Schemes, India has now enhanced its manufacturing capabilities significantly, and the world is also looking at India as a reliable supply chain partner.
