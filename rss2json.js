After a search of more than 40 years, the particle was discovered in experiments on the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN) near Geneva, Switzerland on July 4, 2012.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Considered one of the most important scientific discoveries of the modern era, the Higgs boson provides evidence for the Standard Model of Physics, which describes how various particles make the universe.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Standard Model&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;The Standard Model of particle physics describes how the world is constructed. We know that all matter consists of particles, which are the building blocks of nature. These particles are governed by four types of forces &amp;mdash; gravitation, electromagnetism, the weak force and the strong force. The Standard Model unites the building blocks of nature and three of these four forces (gravitation remains outside the model).&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;For the Standard Model to be correct, the Higgs boson must exist. Without the Higgs boson, the Standard Model would fail. That is why it is known as the God particle.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Higgs boson&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Based on their characteristics, all subatomic particles belong to two broad categories: bosons and fermions. Bosons are named after the Indian physicist Satyendranath Bose who, along with Albert Einstein, proposed a theory on the characteristics of such particles.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;There are several types of bosons, and the Higgs boson is one of them. This particle is named after the scientist Peter Higgs, who won the Nobel Prize for Physics in 2013, jointly with Francois Englert. In 1964, independently of each other, Peter Higgs and the team of Francois Englert and Robert Brout (who died in 2011) had proposed a theory that there is a particle that explains why other particles have a mass. This particle is the Higgs boson.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Connection&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;The Standard Model would only work if particles did not have mass. But most particles do have mass, which is why all matter has mass. How could the Standard Model be correct then?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;&amp;ldquo;This is where Englert, Brout and Higgs entered the stage with the ingenious mechanism for particles to acquire mass that managed to rescue the Standard Model,&amp;rdquo; the Nobel Prize official website says.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;According to physics, space is filled with many invisible fields, such as gravitational field, electromagnetic field etc. One of these is known as the Higgs field, and was proposed by Englert, Brout and Higgs. All particles acquire mass only if they come into contact with the Higgs field. If the Higgs field disappeared, all matter would cease to exist.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;The Higgs particle is a vibration of the Higgs field. But until 2012, it existed only in theory. It had not yet been actually detected.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Discovery&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;The CERN website says the Higgs boson can't be &amp;ldquo;discovered&amp;rdquo; by finding it somewhere. It has to be created in a particle collision. But once created, it quickly decays into other particles. Scientists look for traces of these particles in data collected by the detectors.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;The challenge is that the Higgs boson only appears in about one in a billion LHC collisions. But careful statistical analysis of enormous amounts of data uncovered the particle's faint signal in 2012.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;On July 4, 2012, the ATLAS and CMS collaborations announced the discovery of a new particle. This particle behaved like the proposed Higgs boson should. But was it really the Higgs boson? By examining more data, scientists concluded in March 2013 that, indeed, some kind of Higgs boson had been discovered, according to CERN.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Christoph Paus, the MIT physicist who co-led the effort to detect the particle, is quoted as saying on the MIT website: &amp;ldquo;How could we be sure that it was the Higgs boson and not something else? It certainly looked like the Higgs boson, but our vision was quite blurry. It could have turned out in the following years that it was not the Higgs boson. But as we now know, with so much more data, everything is completely consistent with what the Higgs boson is predicted to look like, so we became comfortable with calling the narrow resonance not just a Higgs-like particle but rather simply the Higgs boson.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;", "link": "https://news.abplive.com/science/god-particle-discovery-10-years-anniversary-all-about-the-higgs-boson-its-link-to-sn-bose-explained-1540627", "published_js": "2022-07-04", "author": "Radifah Kabir"}, {"title": "Several Hit By Gunshots At Shopping Mall In Copenhagen, One Arrested: Danish Police", "summary": "&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;New Delhi:&lt;/strong&gt; Several people have been hit by gunshots at a shopping mall in the capital Denmark in Copenhagen on Sunday, said Danish police as reported by the news agency AFP.

These factors can have a detrimental effect on sleep, alertness, and neurobehavioural performance, all of which are critical to mission success, the study said. In the paper, the study authors predicted neurobehavioural performance over the course of a six-month mission aboard the International Space Station (ISS) using ISS environmental data and self-reported and cognitive data collected longitudinally from 24 astronauts.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How Was Astronauts&amp;rsquo; Neurobehavioural Performance Assessed?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;The researchers assessed neurobehavioural performance repeatedly using a three-minute Psychomotor Vigilance Test (PVT-B) which is highly sensitive to the effects of sleep deprivation.

For astronauts on missions over six months, median shinbone failure load, which is the resistance of the bone to fracture, was reduced by 333.9 newtons after one year compared to pre-flight. As many as nine astronauts were on missions shorter than six months.

This is a phrase dating back to ancient times and is linked with the brightest star in the sky, Sirius.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;The Sun lies in the same part of the sky as Sirius at the peak of summer. Ancient Greeks and Romans associated Sirius with the dog-shaped constellation Canis major. To date, we associate Sirius with Canis major. Sirius is the most prominent star of Canis major, and is sometimes referred to as the &quot;dog star&quot;. Sirius is also known as the Alpha Canis Majoris.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Sirius means &quot;the scorcher&quot; in ancient Greek. During summer, the blazing bright star's proximity in the sky added to the Sun's heat at the peak of summer. This made July extremely hot and oppressive, Greeks and Romans believed. Therefore, they called this hot time of the year the &quot;dog days&quot;.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Centre Of Milky Way Galaxy&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Today, the only star close enough to affect the temperatures on Earth is the Sun, and the Northern Hemisphere being tilted toward the Sun in July causes us to experience the heat in July. Due to this, the Northern Hemisphere witnesses longer days during this time of the year and more direct sunlight. This leads to warmer weather compared to the Southern Hemisphere, where the situation is reversed. In July, the Southern Hemisphere is right in the middle of winter.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;People can look southward on July nights after sunset to witness a sky teeming with bright stars. When one looks in that direction this time of the year, they face the centre of the Milky Way, all night. There are quite a number of bright stars southward in the sky on July nights. These include the constellations Scorpius and Sagittarius.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Teapot&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;One can fully enjoy the Milky Way core under dark skies. The Milky Way can be seen densely packed with stars and dark clouds of dust and gas. Our galaxy dazzles at this time of the year, and as soon as the skies become completely dark, the Milky way becomes visible toward the south. Even if one is under urban skies too bright to observe the Milky way core, they can pinpoint the location of the galaxy in the sky using a group of stars in Sagittarius known as the Teapot.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;According to NASA, the Teapot is a well-known asterism or pattern of stars. Once a person is familiar with the Teapot, it is hard not to see a teapot in the sky. It is easy to spot, similar to Scorpius nearby. The Milky Way's core lies just right of the stars of the Teapot's &quot;spout&quot;.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;The Teapot, over the course of the night, appears to tilt as though its spout is pouring out a cosmic &quot;cuppa&quot;. The Milky Way appears as a plume of steam rising from the spout under dark skies. Therefore, one may either get a chance to enjoy the Milky Way in July, or can find the galaxy's core with the help of the Teapot.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Aphelion&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;The Earth will reach its aphelion, the point on its orbit farthest from the Sun, on July 4 at 7:10 UTC (12:40 pm IST).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Buck Moon or Thunder Moon&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;On July 13-14, people on Earth will witness a full Moon which is a supermoon.

Therefore, a Supermoon&amp;nbsp; appears slightly brighter and larger than a normal full Moon.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Early native American tribes called this full Moon the Buck Moon because the male buck deer would begin to grow their new antlers at this time of the year.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;The Moon is also referred to as the Thunder Moon and the Hay Moon. The supermoon to occur in July is the second of the three supermoons for 2022. Since the Moon will be near its closest approach to Earth, it will appear slightly larger and brighter than usual.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;New Moon&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;On July 28, at 17:55 UTC (11:25 IST), the New Moon will be located on the same side of the Earth as the Sun and will not be visible in the night sky. Since there is no moonlight to interfere with the visibility of cosmic objects, this is the best time of the month to observe faint objects such as galaxies and star clusters. The Milky Way, dog star, and the Teapot may be clearly visible on the new Moon night.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Delta Aquarids Meteor Shower&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;The Delta Aquarids Meteor shower peaks this year on the night of July 28 and morning of July 29.
