"summary": "&lt;p&gt;Munich, Jun 26 (PTI): Terming the imposition of the Emergency in 1975 a &quot;black spot&quot; on the vibrant history of India's democracy, Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Sunday targeted the Congress Party and said that democracy, which is in the DNA of every Indian, was trampled and suppressed 47 years ago, but the people answered the conspiracies to crush it in a democratic way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prime Minister Modi, who is visiting Germany to attend the G7 Summit, made the remarks while addressing thousands of members of the Indian community at a grand event held at the Audi Dome stadium in Munich.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Today is June 26 which is also known as the day when India's democracy, which is in the DNA of every Indian, was trampled and suppressed 47 years ago. Emergency is a black spot on the vibrant history of India's democracy,&quot; Modi said, targeting the opposition Congress Party in a speech from abroad.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Emergency was announced in India on June 25, 1975 when Congress leader Indira Gandhi was the prime minister, and was lifted on March 21, 1977.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;The people of India answered all the conspiracies to crush democracy in a democratic way. We Indians take pride in our democracy wherever we are,&quot; Modi said in his over 30 minutes speech at the indoor arena, described as the largest Indian community event of Prime Minister Modi in continental Europe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Modi said that Indians are proud of their democracy. &quot;Today, we can proudly say that India is the mother of democracy... The diversity of culture, food, clothes, music and traditions makes our democracy vibrant. India has shown that democracy can deliver and has delivered.&quot; \tIn his monthly 'Mann Ki Baat' radio broadcast earlier in the day, Modi had targeted the Congress for imposing the Emergency, and asserted that it is difficult to find another example in the world where people defeated a &quot;dictatorial mindset&quot; through democratic means.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Addressing the Indian community members who had come to Munich after travelling long distances, Modi lauded the contribution of the diaspora in promoting India\u2019s success story and acting as brand ambassadors of India\u2019s success.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Prime Minister highlighted India's growth story and mentioned various initiatives undertaken by the government to further achieve the country\u2019s development agenda.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;In last century, Germany and other countries benefited from the 3rd Industrial Revolution. India was a slave back then that's why it couldn't leverage benefits. But now India will not be left behind in the 4th Industrial Revolution, it's now leading the world,&quot; Modi said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He said India has shown how well democracy is delivering in such a vast and so diverse country.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;The way crores of Indians have achieved big goals together, it is unprecedented. Today every village in India is open defecation free, has electricity and 99% of the villages also have clean cooking fuel. India has been providing free ration to 80 crore poor people since the last 2 years,\u201d he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not only this, in India, on an average, we have a \u2018unicorn\u2019 every 10 days, he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In India, every month on an average 5,000 patents are being filed. Every month, on an average, India makes over 500 railway coaches, provides 18 lakh households clean water, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;There was a time when India was nowhere in the race of startups. Today, we are the third largest startup ecosystem. Similarly, we used to import even the simplest phones, today, we are the second largest mobile phone manufacturer in the world,&quot; Modi said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Modi said that drone technology is being used which is unprecedented. In India\u2019s many places, fertilisers are being sprayed using drones, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He also said that India has started the Swamitwa Yojana under which land\u2019s mapping in Indian villages is being made through drones only.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;This list of achievements is very long. If I keep speaking, your dinner time will be over. When a country takes correct decisions with correct intentions on time, then it is destined for development,&quot; he said, amid chants of Modi-Modi from the crowd.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;In Information technology, digital technology, India is making its presence felt. Forty per cent digital transactions in the world are from India. India is making new records in data consumption. India is among the countries where data is cheapest,\u201d he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the 21st Century's new India, the fast way people adopt technology is exciting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Today's India has come out of the mentality of \u2018It happens, it runs like this\u2019. Today India takes a pledge to 'have to do', 'have to do' and 'have to do on time',\u201d he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;India now is ready, prompt for development, for its dreams. Today, India believes in itself and its capabilities.
