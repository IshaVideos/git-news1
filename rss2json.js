Nitrate, the main source of plant N, is absorbed and transported by nitrate transporters. Nitrate can be metabolized directly in the roots after absorption and stored in the vacuole, but most nitrate is transported to aerial plant parts. N and carbon (C) metabolism are tightly interrelated in plants. N deficiency affects not only N uptake and assimilation but also C assimilation, especially photosynthesis. Protein degradation for N recycling helps plants adapt to N deficiency.", "link": "https://phys.org/news/2022-08-autophagic-pathway-low-nitrogen-tolerance-tomato.html", "published_js": "2022-08-18", "author": "None"}, {"title": "CRISPR-based technology targets global crop pest", "summary": "Applying new CRISPR-based technology to a broad agricultural need, researchers at the University of California San Diego have set their aims on a worldwide pest known to decimate valuable food crops.", "link": "https://phys.org/news/2022-08-crispr-based-technology-global-crop-pest.html", "published_js": "2022-08-18", "author": "None"}]}, "http://feeds.feedburner.com/DiscoverMindBrain": {"feed": {"title": "Mind | Discover Magazine"}, "entries": []}}, "Longform": {"https://www.newscientist.com/section/features/feed/": {"feed": {"title": "New Scientist -
