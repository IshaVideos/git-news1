To do this required a change of the status quo, as Uber became a serious competitor in an industry where competition has been historically outlawed,&quot; Devon Spurgeon, a spokesperson of Kalanick, said in response to the revelations by ICIJ, the report said.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;In August 2014, Uber&amp;rsquo;s then-Asia head Allen Penn reportedly wrote to the Indian team: &quot;We&amp;rsquo;ve definitely made a splash in our first year in India&amp;hellip;We will likely have both local and national issues in almost every city in India&amp;hellip;That&amp;rsquo;s life running a business at Uber.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The details reveal Uber's spats with many Indian administrative specialists, including GST and income tax departments along with consumer forums, the Reserve Bank of India and the service tax department.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Using India as a case study for handling Service Tax issues, the transportation giant prepared a presentation for its staff in 2014, the report said. &amp;ldquo;Authorities want Uber to open their books, otherwise we are facilitating fraud,&amp;rdquo; the report quoted from a slide in a PowerPoint presentation that is part of the records.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;In December 2014, the company was hit by a major crisis after a 25-year-old woman passenger New Delhi was raped in an Uber car by the driver.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Just six days after the rape of the woman, Nairi Hourdajian, then the head of Uber&amp;rsquo;s communications unit, began damage control to manage the situation, the report said. &amp;ldquo;Remember that everything is not in your control and that sometimes we have problems because, well, we&amp;rsquo;re just f***ing illegal,&amp;rdquo; he reportedly wrote an email to his colleague on December 11, 2014.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;According to the IE report, the &amp;ldquo;panic button&amp;rdquo; that was introduced as a &quot;safety feature&quot; soon after the New Delhi rape incident is yet to integrate with the Delhi Police and state transport department's systems.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Their investigation also revealed that in order to keep Uber rides from prying police officers and government authorities, the company used tools like &amp;ldquo;greyball&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;geofencing&amp;rdquo; during Kalanick&amp;rsquo;s tenure.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The files reveal 13 examples of implementing the &quot;kill switch&quot; in a few countries &amp;mdash; it's an in-house marker for a process to shuts down nearly local systems to firewall them from any inquiry. In six cases, the records uncover, the 'kill switch' was involved even as raids by regulators were underway at Uber offices.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;In response to questions sent to Uber's India head Prabhjeet Singh, the company spokesperson said: &amp;ldquo;When Uber launched in India almost a decade ago, no ridesharing regulations existed at that time as the transportation laws did not conceive app-based ride sharing as an option.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The response added: &quot;We have long championed rules and regulations that reflect changing technology and the interest of cities and our customers &amp;ndash; riders and drivers alike. As a category-defining company, we applaud and support progressive regulatory change that is good for riders, drivers and cities.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;", "link": "https://news.abplive.com/news/world/uber-files-cab-transport-giant-used-ruthless-expansion-tactics-to-drive-past-law-icij-journalists-governments-1541813", "published_js": "2022-07-10", "author": "ABP News Bureau"}, {"title": "Sri Lanka Crisis | Oppn Parties Agree To Form All-Party Interim Govt After President's Resignation: Report", "summary": "&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;New Delhi:&lt;/strong&gt; Amid nationwide protests that forced President Gotabaya Rajapaksa and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe to offer their resignations, the Opposition parties of Sri Lanka on Sunday agreed to form an all-party interim government after the anticipated resignation of Gotabaya on Wednesday, news agency PTI reported. &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Amid the political upheaval, Opposition parties held talks to decide on ways to steer the country forward in the current economic crisis after Rajapaksa's resignation.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;We agreed in principle to form a government of unity with all parties participation for an interim period,&quot; PTI quoted Wimal Weerawansa, of the ruling Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna party's breakaway group, as saying. &amp;ldquo;This will be a government where all parties are represented,&quot; he added.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Another leader of the SLPP breakaway group, Vasudeva Nanayakkara said that they need not wait for Rajapaksa's resignation on July 13.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Notably, President Rajapaksa informed Parliament Speaker Mahinda Yapa Abeywardena on Saturday that he is ready to step down from his post on Wednesday after the country's opposition parties demanded his resignation.
