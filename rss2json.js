There has been a growing interest in the study of PAs involved in plant stresses, including drought, hypoxia, high temperature, low temperature, salinity, and metal toxicity. The main role of PAs in plant stress is to counteract the damage caused by reactive oxygen species (ROS) and to prevent free radical damage or oxidative stress while also modulating ion channels to protect the morphology and integrity of cell membranes, nucleic acids, and proteins. PAs interact with hormone pathways (ethylene, jasmonate, auxin, gibberellins, cytokinins, abscisic acid [ABA], salicylic acid, and brassinosteroids) and other signaling molecules (Ca2+, NO, H2O2, and gamma-aminobutyric acid) to help plants cope with adverse environments.", "link": "https://phys.org/news/2022-08-pa-aba-cbf-pathways-synergistically.html", "published_js": "2022-08-04", "author": "None"}, {"title": "How year-round crops could reduce farm pollution in the Mississippi River", "summary": "Don Wyse's field of winter barley used to be mostly empty in the spring.", "link": "https://phys.org/news/2022-08-year-round-crops-farm-pollution-mississippi.html", "published_js": "2022-08-04", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Plant-based 'beef' reduces carbon dioxide but threatens agriculture jobs", "summary": "Plant-based alternatives to beef have the potential to help reduce carbon dioxide emissions, but their growth in popularity could disrupt the agricultural workforce, threatening more than 1.5 million industry jobs, new economic models show.", "link": "https://phys.org/news/2022-08-plant-based-beef-carbon-dioxide-threatens.html", "published_js": "2022-08-04", "author": "None"}]}, "http://feeds.feedburner.com/DiscoverMindBrain": {"feed": {"title": "Mind | Discover Magazine"}, "entries": []}}, "Longform": {"https://www.newscientist.com/section/features/feed/": {"feed": {"title": "New Scientist - Features"}, "entries": []}, "https://feeds.a.dj.com/rss/RSSWSJD.xml": {"feed": {"title": "WSJ.com: WSJD"}, "entries": [{"title": "Amazon Buying Roomba Maker iRobot for $1.7 Billion", "summary": "The deal for the robot vacuum, which would be Amazon\u2019s fourth-largest acquisition, adds to a connected-home portfolio that also includes the Alexa virtual assistant speaker and Ring video doorbell.", "link": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/amazon-buying-roomba-maker-irobot-for-1-7-billion-11659702187?mod=rss_Technology", "published_js": "2022-08-05", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Warner Bros.
