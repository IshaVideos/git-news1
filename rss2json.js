The organisation said the team at the Monjebup Nature Reserve experienced a &quot;jaw-dropping moment&quot; when they peered into a nest box only to discover an orange-eyed southwestern spiny-tailed gecko cosied up with a family of western pygmy possums.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;According to the Facebook post, ecologist Angela Sanders said: &quot;The photos surprised us all&quot;.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Geckos are occasionally found in boxes. However, they have never been seen with possums. &quot;My best guess is that it is getting warmth from the possums. There is limited natural habitat for these animals in the revegetated area, so the boxes are providing vital shelter for them until the vegetation develops to a stage of providing cracks and crevices and loose bark,&quot; Sanders said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;According to an article published by the New York Times, Hams said the pygmy possums and the gecko were climbing all over each other and neither seemed to mind. He added that they were more concerned about the big human heads that were peering in through the top. This was something he had never seen before.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;In the following two weeks, Hams returned to the site and saw that nothing had changed. The pygmy possum mother, her litter of babies, and the two-to-three-inch gecko had not moved to any other place. The pygmy possums and the gecko were genuine roommates, and shared a crowded space that was no more than eight inches deep, the article stated.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Mr Hams said the boxes are small, and added that pygmy possums are so tiny that one could fit a whole family of them in the hand.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Several Australian mammals and birds depend on natural hollows for shelter. The interior of the box has a similar setup. Hams said the pygmy possums use the eucalyptus leaves from nearby trees to establish the nest.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why Were The Gecko And Pygmy Possums Sharing The Same House?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;According to Conrad Hoskin, a gecko expert from James Cook University in Australia, the pygmy possums and the gecko would have no interest in eating each other because possums consume nectar and insects and geckos feed on insects and spiders. Hoskin said that the gecko may be getting something from its nestmates, according to the article.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;He explained that the gecko will get some benefit from being in the warmth of those little mammals, and he suspects the presence of the gecko is neutral to the possum.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;According to Euan Ritchie, a professor in wildlife ecology and conservation at Deakin University in Melbourne, the pygmy possum has made a nest out of all the leaves and twigs, which is exactly the sort of habitat reptiles like. He further said that reptiles like structural complexity and this is a great place for a gecko to hang out.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;While the pygmy possums and geckos are cosied up in the same box, the mammals are unlikely to share their box with spiders. In 2019, dozens of social huntsman spiders took over one of the boxes. In the same year, a huntsman spider reportedly ate a pygmy possum in Tasmania. Around five per cent of the 103 boxes on the Monjebup Nature Reserve are estimated to be the domain of spider colonies, the article stated.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Dr Ritchie said tree hollows have been massively depleted around Australia because of logging, and pygmy possum habitat has become extremely fragmented. According to Dr Ritchie, hollows are likely to form in 100 to 150 years, depending on the tree and habitat.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;The vegetation on Monjebup is very young and undeveloped. It is only nine or 10 years old, and there are no habitats like natural hollows or crevices. Therefore, the nest boxes are the prime habitat, Sanders said. Also, animals that would not normally cohabit are forced together because there is so little habitat, she explained.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Bush Heritage Australia has placed artificial boxes on Monjebup Nature Reserve, which provide shelter for tiny honey possums and pygmy possums.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;", "link": "https://news.abplive.com/science/orange-eyed-gecko-and-family-of-pygmy-possums-are-living-as-roommates-in-western-australia-bush-heritage-australia-monjebup-nature-reserve-1541269", "published_js": "2022-07-07", "author": "ABP News Bureau"}, {"title": "What Songs Should Play When NASA Webb Releases First Image?

To take part in the race, a Tory MP has to be nominated by eight colleagues. If more than two MPs put themselves forward and secure enough nominations to run for leader, a series of secret ballots are held to whittle them down.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was thought that with a large chunk of his Cabinet now calling for his resignation, Johnson would give in and step down.
