First-Of-Its-Kind Study Gives Answers", "summary": "&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Three years back, astronomers spotted the nearest example to date of a star that was shredded or &quot;spaghettified&quot; after approaching too close to a massive black hole. A Sun-like star was tidally disrupted by a black hole which is one million times more massive than the star. Material being blown away from a black hole after it is torn apart is known as tidal disruption, according to NASA.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;The &quot;spaghettification&quot; took place 215 million light years from Earth. Before this, the closest tidal disruption to be discovered in the recent past took place in the centre of a galaxy about 290 million light years away from Earth.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tidal Disruption&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;According to NASA, early in the evolution of a tidal disruption, material from the shredded star should be pulled towards the black hole at a high rate, generating a huge amount of light. As the disrupted material falls into the black hole, the amount of light should decline.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Astronomers from the University of California, Berkeley, were able to study the optical light from the stellar death because this was the first such event bright enough to make it possible to analyse the light.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;The astronomers also studied the light's polarisation, to understand what happened after the star was torn apart. When light reflects off the surface of particles, it can become polarised, which means that its electric fields line up together in the same direction. Normally, electric fields are oriented in all directions.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Star Is Surrounded By A Spherical Cloud&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;The astronomers observed the tidal disruption of the star 215 million light years away on October 8, 2019. These observations suggest that a lot of the star's material was blown away at high up speed, up to 10,000 kilometres per second. The star's material formed a spherical cloud of gas that blocked most of the high-energy emissions produced as the black hole grabbed the remainder of the star.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;The blast was called AT2019qiz. Observations of optical light from the blast had revealed earlier that much of the star's matter was launched outward in a powerful wind. The light's polarisation was essentially zero at visible or optical wavelengths when the event was at its brightest. The new data on the light's polarisation tells astronomers that the cloud of gas was likely spherically symmetric.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;The study describing the results was recently published in the journal &lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What Makes The Study Unique?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;In a statement released by University of California, Berkeley, Alex Filippenko, one of the authors on the paper, said this is the first time anyone has deduced the shape of the gas cloud around a tidally spaghettified star.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;The new study gives an answer to why astronomers do not see high-energy radiation, such as X-rays, from many of the dozens of tidal disruption events observed to date. According to the study, the X-rays, which are produced by material ripped from the star and dragged into an accretion disk around the black hole before falling inward, are obscured from view by the gas blown outward by powerful winds from the black hole.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Kishore Patra, the lead author on the paper, said the observation rules out a class of solutions that have been proposed theoretically and gives astronomers a stronger constraint on what happens to gas around a black hole.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;He further said that people have been seeing other evidence of wind coming out of these events, and that the polarisation study definitely makes that evidence stronger, in the sense that one would not get a spherical geometry without having a sufficient amount of wind. He explained that interestingly, a significant fraction of the material in the star that is spiralling inward does not eventually fall into the black hole. Rather, it is blown away from the black hole.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How Light Polarisation Reveals Symmetry&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;According to theorists, stellar debris forms an eccentric, asymmetric disk after tidal disruption. However, an eccentric disk is expected to show a relatively high degree of polarisation, which would mean that several per cent of the total light is polarised. But this was not observed for the tidal disruption event studied.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Wenbin Lu, one of the authors on the paper, said one of the craziest things a supermassive black hole can do is to shred a star by its enormous tidal forces. He explained that stellar tidal disruption events are one of very few ways astronomers know the existence of supermassive black holes at centres of galaxies and measure their properties. However, astronomers still do not understand the complicated processes after a tidal disruption because of the extreme cost in numerically simulating such events.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Light Was Found To Be Slightly Polarised In A Different Set Of Observations&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;On November 26, 2019, astronomers made a second set of observations. These observations, made 29 days after the October observation, revealed that the light was very slightly polarised, about one per cent. This suggests that the cloud had thinned enough to reveal the asymmetric gas structure around the black hole.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Both the October and November observations were made using the three-metre Shane telescope at Lick Observatory near San Jose, California. The telescope is fitted with the Kast spectrograph, an instrument that can determine the polarisation of light over the full optical spectrum. According to the study, the light becomes polarised when it scatters off electrons in the gas cloud.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Patra said the accretion disk is hot enough to emit most of its light in X-rays, but that light has to come through this cloud. Also, there are many scatterings, absorptions and reemissions of light before it can escape out of the cloud.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;He further said that with each of these processes, the light loses some of its photon energy, going all the way down to ultraviolet and optical energies. The final scatter then determines the polarisation state of the photon. Therefore, by measuring polarisation, one can deduce the geometry of the surface where the final scatter happens.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;According to Patra, this deathbed scenario may apply only to normal tidal disruptions, and not &quot;oddballs&quot;, in which relativistic jets of material are expelled out of the poles of the black hole. The question can be answered only after more measurements of the polarisation of light are made.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Patra said polarisation studies are an &quot;uncharted territory&quot; for tidal disruption events.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gas Cloud Around The Star Is 100 Times Larger Than Earth's Orbit&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;The astronomers calculated that the polarised light was emitted from the surface of a spherical cloud with a radius of about 100 astronomical units. An astronomical unit is a unit of measurement equal to 149.6 million kilometres, the mean distance from the centre of the Earth to the centre of the Sun.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;The surface of the spherical cloud was 100 times farther from the star than Earth is from the Sun. According to the study, an optical glow from hot gas emanated from a region at about 30 astronomical units.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;The 2019 spectropolarimetric observations were of AT2019qiz, a tidal disruption event located in a special galaxy in the constellation of Eridanus. Spectropolarimetric observation is a technique that measures polarisation across many wavelengths of light.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;According to the study, the zero polarisation of the entire spectrum in October indicates a spherically symmetrical cloud gas. This is because all the polarised photons balance one another.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;In the November measurements, a slight polarisation was observed. This indicates a small asymmetry.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;The tidal disruptions appear as only a point of light because they occur very far away, in the centres of distant galaxies. Therefore polarisation is one of few indications of the shapes of objects, the study said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Filippenko explained that these disruption events are so far away that one cannot really resolve them. So, one cannot study the geometry of the event or the structure of these explosions.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;However, studying polarised light actually helps researchers to deduce some information about the distribution of the matter in that explosion, he said. In this case, studying the polarised light helped astronomers deduce information about how the gas, and possibly the accretion disk, around the black hole is shaped.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;", "link": "https://news.abplive.com/science/black-hole-spaghettifies-star-spaghettification-light-polarisation-gas-cloud-study-know-all-details-1542478", "published_js": "2022-07-14", "author": "Radifah Kabir"}, {"title": "Rishi Sunak On Winning Streak As 5 Left In UK PM Race", "summary": "&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;New Delhi:&lt;/strong&gt; Rishi Sunak tightened his grip on the race to replace Boris Johnson as Conservative Party leader and British prime minister as he bagged 101 votes to again emerge as the winner of the latest voting round on Thursday.

In Japan, it was found in just nine per cent of cases (5/58).&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;According to UN News, owing to limited adenovirus surveillance in most countries, it is quite possible that the true number of cases of child hepatitis is higher than currently known.&lt;/p&gt;", "link": "https://news.abplive.com/news/world/mystery-child-hepatitis-outbreak-surpasses-1-000-cases-in-35-countries-who-1542445", "published_js": "2022-07-14", "author": "ABP News Bureau"}, {"title": "WATCH | Sri Lanka Military Personnel Guard PM's Chair From Protesters", "summary": "&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Several protesters Wednesday stormed the Prime Minister&amp;rsquo;s office at Flower Road in the capital city Colombo after the country&amp;rsquo;s embattled President Gotabaya Rajapaksa fled the country.

This is an image of the galaxy cluster SMACS 0723, and is &quot;overflowing with detail&quot;, according to the European Space Agency. The galaxy cluster is present near the constellation Volans in the southern sky.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Thousands of galaxies and the faintest objects ever observed in infrared light have appeared in Webb's view.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;The image has been captured by Webb's Near-Infrared Camera (NIRCam), and is a composite made from images at different wavelengths, totalling 12.5 hours. According to NASA, the combined mass of the galaxy cluster SMACS 0723 acts as a gravitational lens, magnifying more distant galaxies. The powerful gravitational field of the galaxy cluster bent the light rays from the distant galaxies behind it, similar to a magnifying glass.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Some of the galaxies are from the early universe, when the universe was less than a billion years old.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Webb's First Deep Field shows the galaxy cluster SMACS 0723 as it appeared 4.6 billion years ago. The NIRCam instrument has brought distant galaxies into sharp focus. These galaxies have tiny, faint structures that have never been seen before, including star clusters and diffuse features.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;It took billions of years for the light from these galaxies to reach us. When viewing the youngest galaxies in Webb's First Deep Field, we are looking back in time to a few 100 million years after the Big Bang. Due to the expansion of the universe, the light was stretched to infrared wavelengths that Webb was designed to observe.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Webb has also captured stars, which appear brighter at shorter wavelengths.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;The galaxy cluster has also been captured by Webb's Mid-Infrared Instrument (MIRI). The MIRI image offers a kaleidoscope of colours and highlights where the dust is present.

The exoplanet is a type of gas giant without any direct analogue in the solar system, and has a mass less than half that of Jupiter, and a diameter 1.2 times greater.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;With a temperature greater than 1000 degrees Fahrenheit, WASP-96 b is significantly hotter, and orbits extremely close to its Sun-like star, at just one-ninth the distance between Mercury and the Sun.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;The exoplanet is an ideal target for atmospheric observations because of the combination of large size, short orbital period, puffy atmosphere, and lack of contaminating light from objects nearby in the sky.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;On June 21, Webb's NIRISS measured light from the WASP-96 b system for 6.4 hours as the planet moved across the star, and as a result, a light curve and a transmission spectrum were obtained. As the exoplanet transits the star's disc, its light dims.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;The light curve confirms properties of the exoplanet that had previously been determined from other observations, and the transmission spectrum reveals previously hidden details of the atmosphere, including the unambiguous signature of water, indications of haze, and evidence of clouds that were not thought to exist.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;By comparing the starlight filtered through a planet's atmosphere as it moves across the star to the unfiltered starlight detected when the planet is beside the star, researchers made a transmission spectrum. The NIRISS is the most detailed exoplanet spectrum to date.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;According to NASA, the spectrum will help researchers measure the amount of water vapour in the atmosphere, determine the abundance of various elements like carbon and oxygen, and estimate the temperature of the atmosphere with depth. Using this information, researchers can determine the overall make-up of the planet, and know how, when, and where it formed.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Webb's 270-square-foot gold-coated mirror collects infrared light efficiently.

Most of the multi-coloured points seen in the image are galaxies, not stars.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;The Southern Ring planetary nebula has been imaged using the Near-Infrared Camera (NIRCam) and the Mid Infra-Red Instrument (MIRI).&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Two stars, locked in a tight orbit, shape the local landscape of the cosmic entity. The image from Webb's NIRCam (left) shows the stars and their layers of light. Meanwhile, the image from Webb's MIRI (right) shows for the first time that the second star is surrounded by dust.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Hundreds of stars and background galaxies are seen in the near-infrared image, while dusty planet-forming disks around young stars are seen in the mid-infrared image.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;According to NASA, the brighter star, which is in an earlier stage of its evolution, will probably eject its own planetary nebula in the future.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;The brighter star influences the appearance of the nebula. As the two stars orbit one another, they &quot;stir the pot&quot; of gas and dust. This causes asymmetrical patterns.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;The dimmer star seen at the centre of the nebula has been sending out rings of gas and dust for thousands of years in all directions, and Webb has revealed for the first time that the star is cloaked in dust.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;According to NASA, each shell of gas represents an episode where the fainter star lost some of its mass. The widest shells of gas, seen toward the outer areas of the nebula, were ejected earlier. The shells of gas closest to the star and the most recent. By tracing these elections, researchers can look into the history of the system.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;NIRCam has also made observations which reveal extremely fine rays of light around the planetary nebula. There are holes in the gas and dust from which starlight streams out.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;According to NASA, observing a nebula is like watching a movie in exceptionally slow motion because planetary nebulae exist for tens of thousands of years. The shells of gas puffed by the star give researchers the ability to precisely measure the gas and dust present in the planetary nebula.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Dust and molecules form within the shells of material ejected by the star. This changes the landscape even as the star continues to expel material. The dust eventually enriches the areas around it, and expands into the Interstellar medium. The dust is very long-lived, because of which it may end up travelling through space for billions of years and become incorporated into a new star or planet.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;The delicate layers of gas and dust seen in the Southern Planetary Nebula will dissipate into surrounding space in thousands of years.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stephan's Quintet: Webb Captures Dancing Galaxies&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;figure class=&quot;image&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://feeds.abplive.com/onecms/images/uploaded-images/2022/07/14/9bb74f8e75528ef78a4840046fa47a991657789929_original.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Stephan's Quintet&quot; /&gt;\n&lt;figcaption&gt;Stephan's Quintet&lt;/figcaption&gt;\n&lt;/figure&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;The fourth full-colour image is that of a galaxy group called &quot;Stephan's Quintet&quot;.

It is located in the constellation Pegasus.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Webb's fourth image shows in rare detail how interacting galaxies trigger star formation in each other.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;According to NASA, Webb's image shows outflows driven by a black hole in Stephan's Quintet in a level of detail never seen before.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;The early universe was superheated, as a result of which infalling material may have fuelled very energetic black holes called quasars. Also, tight galaxy groups like Stephan's Quintet are likely to have been more common in the early universe.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;The enormous mosaic of Stephan's Quintet is the largest image to date from the Webb Space Telescope. It contains over 150 million pixels and is constructed from almost 1,000 separate image files, and provides new insights into how galactic interactions may have driven galactic evolution in the early universe.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;The MIRI and NIRCam instruments captured the visual grouping of the five galaxies of Stephan's Quintet. Together, the galaxies are also known as the Hickson Compact Group 92.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;The galaxies in Stephan's Quintet are in a galactic dance with each other. The image sheds light into galaxy evolutions and black holes.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Webb's picture shows sparkling clusters of millions of young stars and starburst regions of fresh star birth.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Due to gravitational interventions, sweeping tails of gas, dust and stars are being pulled from several of the galaxies. Webb has captured huge shock waves as one of the galaxies, NGC 7318B, smashed through the cluster.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Only four of the galaxies in Stephan's Quintet are truly close together and caught in a cosmic dance. NGC 7320, the fifth and leftmost galaxy, is in the foreground, compared with the other four. The galaxy is present 40 million light-years away from Earth. Meanwhile, the other four galaxies &amp;mdash; NGC 7317, NGC 7318A, NGC 7318B, and NGC 7319 &amp;mdash; are about 290 million light-years away from Earth.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;According to NASA, this distance is fairly close in cosmic terms, compared with more distant galaxies billions of light-years away. Scientists can better understand structures seen in a much more distant universe by studying such relatively nearby galaxies.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Scientists rarely get the opportunity to see in detail how interacting galaxies trigger star formation in each other, and how the gas in these galaxies is being disturbed. According to NASA, Stephan's Quintet is a fantastic &quot;laboratory&quot; for studying these processes fundamental to all galaxies.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;NGC 7319, the topmost galaxy in the group, harbours an active galactic nucleus, which is a supermassive black hole 24 million times the mass of the Sun. The active galactic nucleus is actively pulling in material and puts out light energy equivalent to 40 billion Suns.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Using the Near-Infrared Spectrograph (NIRSpec) and MIRI, Webb has studied the active galactic nucleus in great detail. The instruments helped the Webb team obtain a collection of images of the galactic core's spectral features.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;The telescope pierced through the shroud of dust surrounding the nucleus to reveal hot gas near the active black hole and measure the velocity of bright outflows, and saw the outflows driven by the black hole in unprecedented detail.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Webb was able to resolve individual stars in NGC 7320 and also the galaxy's bright core.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;The JWST revealed a vast sea of thousands of distant background galaxies as a bonus.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;The most detailed image of the Stephan's Quintet, along with Webb data, will help scientists understand the rate at which supermassive black holes feed and grow, and to see star-forming regions more directly.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cosmic Cliffs: Glittering Landscape Of Starbirth&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;figure class=&quot;image&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://feeds.abplive.com/onecms/images/uploaded-images/2022/07/14/f12ed24ae5b540b847421c20acc465b01657790027_original.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Cosmic Cliffs in Carina Nebula&quot; /&gt;\n&lt;figcaption&gt;Cosmic Cliffs in Carina Nebula&lt;/figcaption&gt;\n&lt;/figure&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;The fifth and final full-colour image captured by the James Webb Space Telescope is that of the Carina Nebula. The image reveals baby stars in the Carina Nebula, where ultraviolet radiation and stellar winds shape colossal walls of dust and gas.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Webb's fifth and final full-colour image reveals emerging stellar nurseries and individual stars in the Carina Nebula.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;The image is called &quot;Cosmic Cliffs&quot;, and is a seemingly three-dimensional picture. A landscape of &quot;mountains&quot; and &quot;valleys&quot; speckled with glittering stars can be seen in the image.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;The landscape is the edge of a nearby, young star-forming region called NGC 3324 in the Carina Nebula. Webb has captured the image in infrared light.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;&amp;ldquo;Cosmic Cliffs&amp;rdquo; reveals for the first time previously invisible areas of star birth. The image reveals the &quot;glittering landscape&quot; of star birth.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Webb's extreme sensitivity, spatial resolution, and imaging capability helped capture the cosmic objects in the earliest, rapid phases of star formation.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;NGC 3324 is located roughly 7,600 light-years away from Earth. Webb's NIRCam and MIRI captured the star-forming region. The tallest peaks seen in the image are about seven light-years high.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Due to intense ultraviolet radiation and stellar winds from extremely massive, hot, young stars, a cavernous area has been carved from the nebula. The young stars are located in the centre of the bubble. The stars can be seen in the top of the image.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Webb's NIRCam instrument has unveiled hundreds of previously hidden stars, and even numerous background galaxies.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;MIRI has revealed the structures that are embedded in the dust and uncovered the stellar sources of massive outflows.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;According to NASA, the blistering, ultraviolet radiation from the young stars is sculpting the Carina nebula's wall by slowly eroding it away. Pillars resisting this radiation tower above the glowing wall of gas.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;A &quot;steam&quot; appears to rise from the celestial &quot;mountains&quot;. The steam is actually hot, ionised gas and hot dust streaming away from the nebula due to the blistering ultraviolet radiation.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Through its infrared vision, Webb reveals emerging stellar nurseries and individual stars that are completely hidden in visible-light pictures. Webb can peer through cosmic dust to see objects because of its sensitivity to infrared light.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Protostellar jets, which are intriguing signspots of star formation, can be seen in the image. These jets shoot out from some of the young stars.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;The youngest stars appear as red spots in the dark, dusty region of the cloud, according to NASA.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Webb's observations of NGC 3324 will shed light on the process of star formation. The birth of a star propagates over time, and is triggered by the expansion of the eroding cavity.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;The bright, ionised rim moves into the nebula, and slowly pushes into the gas and dust.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;The pressure in the rim may increase if it encounters any unstable material. This will trigger the material to collapse and form new stars.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;However, the same disturbance may prevent star formation. This is because the star-forming material is eroding away. According to NASA, this is a very delicate balance between sparking star formation and stopping it. Some of the questions of modern astrophysics which Webb will answer include what determines the number of stars forming in a certain region and why stars form with a certain mass.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Other information which Webb will unveil include the impact of star formation on the evolution of gigantic clouds of gas and dust. Low-mass stars create narrow, opposing jets as they form. This injects a lot of momentum and energy into the clouds of gas and dust, reducing the fraction of nebular material that seeds new stars.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Webb's NIRCam, which has crisp resolution and unparalleled sensitivity, has unveiled hundreds of previously hidden stars, and numerous background galaxies.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Young stars and their dusty planet-forming disks have appeared in MIRI's view. These discs shine brightly in the mid-infrared, and appear pink and red. MIRI has revealed structures embedded in the dust, and has uncovered the stellar sources of massive jets and outflows.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Scottish astronomer James Dunlop was the first to catalogue NGC 3324. The star-forming region is located at the northwest corner of the Carina Nebula, which resides in the constellation Carina.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;The Keyhole Nebula, and the active, unstable supergiant star called Eta Carinae are also present in the Carina Nebula.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jupiter, Its Moons, And Ring&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;figure class=&quot;image&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://feeds.abplive.com/onecms/images/uploaded-images/2022/07/14/5f174b87a88ed7f940206fa58188c00f1657790108_original.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Webb's images of Jupiter&quot; /&gt;\n&lt;figcaption&gt;Webb's images of Jupiter&lt;/figcaption&gt;\n&lt;/figure&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Webb has tracked solar system objects at speeds more than twice the requirement.
